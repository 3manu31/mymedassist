In general, the main pathologies interesting the esophagus are congenital pathologies, meaning that they regard infants. There are two important features associated with the morphology of the esophagus: atresia and fistula. Atresia is the interruption of a part of the esophagus, while a fistula is associated with other organs, not only in the esophagus but also in the gastrointestinal tract. Fistula is defined as the abnormal connection between one organ that has a hollow structure and another organ. Speaking about the atresia in the esophagus, it is in general congenital and can come with or without fistulae. It is a sporadic disease (although it remains the most common congenital anomaly of the stomach) linked to soon birthing infants and ranges from 1 in every 2,000-3,000 births; the main symptom experienced by these infants is low weight. Nowadays, thanks to the increase in the money in neonatal intensive care and the surgeons, there is an increase in the possibility of these infants to survive. ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA Fig. 1 Atresias are classified into five main types, from A to E, with another additional type that is the F type. These types are also linked to the severity of the disease, which is considered as II, III, IIIb, IIIa or H-type. - Type A is only atresia, so there is a fraction. There is a complete block of the canalicular structure of the esophagus, so we have atresia in the upper part and also in the bottom part; - Type B presents an atresia in the bottom part and a fistula in the upper part; - Type C is exactly the opposite, so the atresia is in the upper part; - Type D presents two fistulae; - In type E, there is a fistula between the esophagus and trachea without atresia. So, on the fistula Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 11 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 there is a narrowing of the trachea and a narrowing of the esophagus, with a fistula that is concentrated in one part only without the atresia; - Type F is the additional one, which is congenital and it induces a stenosis (an occlusion of the esophagus). What happens in the esophagus undergoing these different types of alterations (fig.2)? Fig.2 There is a narrowing of the esophagus which is called esophageal stenosis, there can be an achalasia, an ectopia or a reflux esophagitis. Achalasia is a loss of peristalsis of the esophagus, due to the alteration in the muscles, meaning that the esophagus is unable to maintain relaxation and contraction. The symptomatology of this achalasia is a pain in the retro-sternal part. Ectopia occurs when some residues from the diet, from the nutrients, are present; these types of residues can be due to eating and can be due also to the presence of, in the case of chronic gastritis, of gastric mucosa into the esophagus. The presence of gastric mucosa in the esophagus can induce also an alteration in the morphology, associated with pre-cancerous conditions, for example the Barret’s esophagus. In general, it is a kind of metaplasia when part of the tissue, in the case of the esophagus, becomes structurally like the type of mucosa present in the stomach. Because the gastric mucosa is in the ectopic part, in the esophagus it can produce acids like in the stomach and can induce the Barret’s esophagus, which is a metaplasia and can become cancer, that’s why it is pre-cancerous. There can also be a development in the symptomatology, very similar to ectopia, which is reflux esophagitis: it is due to an alteration in the mechanism of contraction. So, there is also in this case the possibility of developing Barrett’s esophagus. Another cause of reflux esophagitis can be also herniation, in particular, the hiatal hernia, which causes a herniation of the stomach through the diaphragm. The hiatal hernia can be divided into different types of morphologies (fig.3): - Sliding hiatal hernia, which is when a part of the stomach is inserted into the level the diaphragmatic hiatus (so it can insert itself towards the upper part, towards the esophagus). Paraesophagealhernia (it is less common) is when this herniation is a protuberance in the Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice Fig. 3 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 lateral part, also in this case for dilation of the diaphragmatic hiatus, so there is a kind of dislocation of the gastric mucosa. These two are the main types that we can see in the clinical practice. The other alterations are particular: Acalasia corresponds, in this case, to the narrowing of part of this portion of the gastric mucosa. This type of achalasia can also induce the formation of fibrous protrusions into the channel, which are called Schatzki rings, where the mucosal part develops into the median part of the esophagus. - The other alteration is the reflux esophagitis (fig.4) : as it has been said before, the reflux is due to, in general, a metaplasia and therefore consists of a change of the type of tissue, and of the function of the tissue, since the stratified squamous epithelium in the esophagus is replaced by the mucosal columnar epithelium of the stomach to counteract the presence of the reflux and so the presence of the acids that come from the stomach. Fig.4, for example, shows a mild reflux of esophagitis, in which these red cells are eosinophils, and this tissue, that now is still a stratified squamous epithelium is completely changed with the mucosal and columnar epithelium, like in the stomach, with an increase also of eosinophils into the tissue. And therefore, if this esophagitis becomes chronic (and so if it becomes a disease which is called chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease), it can induce Barret’s esophagus. Fig. 4 hypertension. The fibrotic tissue is the one that induces a narrowing of the portal vein so, when there is a block in the portal vein, it is an example of the formation of collateral veins . Collateral veins are collateral vessels that form Another type of damage into the esophagus are the varices (fig.5 and 6). The main esophageal varices sources are the veins produced during a portal Fig.5 Fig.6 when there is an increase in the blood flow, which in turn lead to an increase in the pressure against the wall of the vessels. These esophageal varices can be broken, and so the rupture results into the esophageal bleeding. STOMACH DISEASES The stomach can be interested by different types of diseases: gastritis, which is the damage to the structure of the stomach, for example due to a wound or ulceration (in this case there is a necrosis of the mucosa). There can also be an obstruction of the gastric mucosa that can be due, for example, to the presence of antigens or to the presence of a tumor. There can also be the so-called gastric constipation, consisting of a sensation of feeling unease. There can also be a benign hypertrophy of the muscles at the level of the pylorus, which can close the stomach (emptying it) and can close the passage of dietary compounds. Some particular types of changes in the morphology, like dilation, torsion, a tumor, the alteration for different causes of the Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 13 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 motility of the muscles are associated with the ulcer. GASTRITIS Gastritis is an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, and, in general, is an alteration of the surface of the mucosa: this causes an alteration in the production of mucins. Mucins are very important for the mucosa because they protect it from suffering damages caused by the acid. Gastritis can be due to different factors. We can have different types of symptomatology, depending on the causes: - Epigastric pyrosis, which causes a sensation of a burden on the stomach. When there is pyrosis, the symptom can radiate to the back. So, when you are in the presence of a patient that has a pain on the back, it is also possible that it can be due to gastritis.; - Frequent belching and gurgling of the stomach that is due to the hyperproduction the gastric acids - Nausea and vomit; - Fever (only in the case of acute gastritis); - Inflammation of the gastric mucosa is associated in general to the damage on the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, so on the esophagus. It can also be associated with a sensation of pain also in the bottom, so it can also be associated with an alteration in the motility and the absorption of the intestinal tract, so inducing diarrhea and abdominal swelling. Gastritis is divided into two types, acute and chronic, depending on the duration of the disease and on the amount of damage. The acutegastritis has many possible causes, which can be: Ingestion of acid or basic substances (in particular aliphatic acids, which have a corrosive action). - Ingestion of natural detergents (like lecithins for example) as they induce a physical damage of the mucosa. Excessive alcohol intake, which can induces inflammation, edema and inflammatory infiltrates. It can cause an erosion, so also a necrosis of the mucosa, and then an ulcer. In this case, the cause of the excessive alcohol ingestion is called as alcoholic gastritis. Smoking . Chemotherapies also can induce damage to the mucosa. Helicobacter pylori, which is the only bacteria known to be a risk factor for gastritis. Helicobacter pylori can be associated with acute gastritis but is especially associated with chronic gastritis. Some components which are very important in inducing acute gastritis, are drugs such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The acetylsalicylic acid is, obviously, an acid, so it decreases the pH, because it is dissociated, and induces an increase in the acidity. This increase of hydrogen ions stimulates the release of histamine, and this in turn induces an over-secretion of chloride acid, therefore there is an amplification in the production by the mucus of chloride acid. All of these conditions can increase inflammation, so we can also see edema in the mucosal layer. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the mediator of inflammation, prostaglandins: their function is to reduce the production of mucus, therefore, if there is a reduction of the mucus on the layer, it cannot defend itself from the caustic acids. The evolution of acute gastritis is not only inflammation, but a massive wound necrosis that induces hemorrhaging, because it is inserted in the deeper layers of the stomach and not only in the superficial mucosa. The maximum evolution is the formation of this acute hemorrhagic erosive gastritis. Therefore, remember, when there is a gastritis, do not give to the patient aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Cortisone and corticosterone are better than these anti-inflammatory drugs. That’s why, also, when we need to ingest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, we have to ingest them after eating: this is done to defend the gastric mucosa from the effect of these drugs. Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 14 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 Chronic gastritis is a chronic inflammation classified into two types, specific and non-specific. Therefore, we can sub-classify chronic gastritis depending on the morphology of the gastric mucosa. Specific chronic gastritis is due to a specific cause, for example, a bacterial infection, and in particular, Helicobacter. Among the different types of helicobacters, the main one which is responsible for chronic gastritis is Helicobacter pylori. The non-specific types of chronic gastritis are dependent on the morphology and the cells that are involved in this inflammation: Lymphoplasmacyticgastritis is due to the infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the lamina propria of the stomach, the deeper part of the mucosa; - Eosinophilic gastritis, is due to the infiltration of eosinophils. This is in particular very rare and is present in children or young people only; - Granulomatousgastritis, where we can see a granuloma, a chronic type of inflammation where we have a high quantity of inflammatory cells in general. This type of granuloma is associated with the presence of another disease, an intestinal disease, called Crohn's disease. When we have an intestinal disease, we also have a link to the other part of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the stomach. When these repeated inflammations are present, there can be the damaging and necrosis of an area of the stomach. The necrosis can be accompanied by inflammation and the formation of granulation Fig.7 tissue, which is the tissue part of the wound repair. So, there is a necrosis, there is a repair association, and therefore the presence of the positional fibrous tissue, so the presence of a fibrous reaction. This is called peptic ulcer (fig.7) . It is exactly defined as a lesion characterized by a denuded mucosa, with the defect extending into the submucosa and muscularis propria: it is always accompanied by acid hypersecretion and, as I told you before, the main risk factors are those that can reduce the mucosal failure of the gastric mucosa in the stomach, which are infection (for example from helicobacter pylori) alcohol and tobacco consumption, acids, and non-steroidal drugs. The main among all these are non-steroidal drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and helicobacter pylori infections. The ulcer induces erosion which ion turn causes hemorrhages. Considering that there is also in this case, like in Barret’s esophagus, an alteration in the function of these cells, this ulcer can be a risk for the development of neoplastic transformation. Fig.8 Fig.8 shows the normal mucosa, that is the upper part, which produces the mucus during chronic gastritis; with injury, this mucus can be reduced and this reduction of the mucus induces the increase in the damage, also in the deeper layers of the stomach. So, it can induce an alteration in the reduction of inflammation and Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 15 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 the formation of wounds, and so, ulcers in the deeper layers. HELICOBACTER PYLORI As we said before, helicobacter pylori is the main source of chronic gastritis, although it rarely can also cause acute gastritis. The action of helicobacter pylori was discovered recently, only 10 years ago. What is the mechanism behind chronic gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori? Helicobacter pylori produces urease, which is an enzyme that hydrolyzes urea into CO2 and ammonia. Ammonia is used by the helicobacter pylori to maintain a basic environment around itself. On the other hand, the formation of CO2 in presence of the hydrogen ions can produce an increase in the acidic environment of stomach cavity. So, it can decrease the pH, and this acidic pH is able to cause damage to the stomach mucosa. In the meantime, the bacteria defends itself by surrounding itself in an environment full of ammonia. The different steps by which helicobacter pylori can induce damage are, first of all, the induction of an alteration in the morphology and in the function of the stomach. So, it induces atrophic gastritis which can also develop intestinal metaplasia. Intestinal metaplasia is a type of metaplasia when the tissue in the lower part of the stomach changes its morphology and becomes like the first part of the intestine (the fundus of the stomach becomes like the tissue in the tenue). There is also an alteration in the function of the intestine and so an alteration in the digestion of the upper part of the intestine. This is a metaplasia that can spread also in the lower parts of the intestine, which becomes colonic metaplasia: therefore the damage involves not only the stomach but also the intestine. In fact, it can be assumed that helicobacter pylori can be also a risk factor for intestinal damage. It causes dysplasia and carcinoma, in particular in the gastric portion. Helicobacter pylori induces not only damage by increasing the acidic environment of the stomach, but also because it expresses two types of proteins, which are VacA and CagA. The first one is vacuolizing cytotoxin-associated protein type A (VacA), which is able to induce the damage and cleave the membrane of the mitochondria. Between the two membranes of the mitochondria (remember that mitochondria have an external membrane, an internal membrane, and then a matrix in between) there is cytochrome C. If this external membrane is cleaved, cytochrome C is able to enter the cytoplasm and activate the apoptotic program. So, there is this activation by this protein expressed by the helicobacter pylori, which is associated with the induction of the damage, to the induction of apoptosis on mucosa cells, to the amplification of the gastric lesions, and therefore the progression towards the malignant phenotype. The other protein, called cytotoxin-associated genetypeA (CagA), expressed by helicobacter pylori, activates the tyrosine kinases. These tyrosine kinases are kinases or enzymes that are increased during the malignant progression because they are involved in the mitogenic response of the mucosal cells. Hence, in this case, the expression of this gene by the helicobacter pylori is associated with the progression of gastritis toward atrophy, and then cancer. There are three types of tests to diagnose the presence of Helicobacter pylori. Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 16 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 Fig.9 The first type is the breath test (fig.9) , which is based on the capacity of the helicobacter pylori to cleave urea into ammonia and CO 2. If we give patients capsules that contain urea in which the carbon is radioactive (to give radioactive urea), if they are infected by helicobacter pylori, they exhale the radioactive CO2 due to the cleavage, by the helicobacter pylori, of urea into ammonia and CO 2. The CO2 reaches the lung and then when we exhale the respiration, we can analyze the quantity of radioactive carbon exhaled. This is a very simple test and it is the main type of analysis. Other types of analysis have been set up, like serological tests evaluating the immunoglobulins associated with the infection of helicobacter pylori, like IgG, IgA, but this is a very generic serological test. The other important specific test is the analysis of the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stools, by using an antibody against helicobacter pylori: this type of analysis is called Helicobacter pylori stool antigen test (HPSA). The main one, however, is still the breath test. Q: Why do you say that the serologic test is not so specific? A: It is not specific because you are going to see only the amount of IgG or IgA, which may be increased also due to other things. Q: So cross-reaction? A: No cross-reactions. For example, if there is an increase in IgA there can be an infection or an inflammation associated with intestinal diseases. Q: So IgG and IgA are not specific for helicobacter pylori? A: No, you just see the spectrum of the different types of immunoglobulins and you see the presence of these two. INTESTINAL DISEASES In the intestine there are different types of diseases. We can divide the diseases of the intestine into the malabsorption syndromes in general (due to the alteration of the motility of the intestine) and into the inflammatory disorders (due to ingestion of a particular type of food, the presence of cancer or chronic inflammation): the two main inflammatory disorders are Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Talking about malabsorption syndromes, they can be due to the alteration in the absorption due to, for example, alteration in the digestion of foods and in the transport throughout the different types of intestinal layers, and also due to the reduction of the absorption area, causing malabsorption of the nutrients from the portion of the intestine. Which are these malabsorption syndromes? There is an increase in substances vaguely digested, which induce the alteration in the ions and the production of mucins at the level of the intestine, especially the tenue (in the upper part of the intestine). So, we have intestinal water influx due to the alteration of the osmosis between the internal part of the intestine and the external part, where these vaguely digested substances are present. There is also the enzymatic attack by bacteria, because of the presence of the microflora in the lumen of the intestine. They are very important because they act by using their enzymes to cleave or to metabolize particular types of nutrients that are ingested. But in the case of maintaining badly digested substances, they can be altered by the bacteria and so they can induce the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. So, these undigested substances can be cleaved towards the induction of Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 17 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 inflammation. These malabsorption syndromes cause accelerated or reduced transit conditions: these alterations can induce either diarrhea or stipsi (also called constipation). We have diarrhea when there is an acceleration of the transit into the intestine and stipsi when there is a reduced transit into the intestinal lumen. These changes can be due to the alterations in the contraction of the muscle layer of the intestine (there are a mucosa and a muscular layer in the different layers of the intestine). These obstructions, these alterations, can be due to, for example, be mechanical or functional damages. In particular, the obstructions that can induce diarrhea or constipation can be present in the upper part of the intestine, so in the small bowel. Why? Because small bowel obstructions are more common than large bowel obstructions due to the diameter, the physical diameter of this upper part has a lumen that is smaller Fig.10 than the large bowel. The obstruction can also be due, not only to the physical presence of material, but also due to changes in the morphologies of the intestine. In this case, it is an abdominal hernia that induces an intrusion, due to a weakness of the wall of the abdominal intestine; we can also have abdominal adhesions, especially due to abdominal surgeries (fig.10). These intra-abdominal fibrous formations are frequent and in general they can link the peritoneal membrane and are due to abdominal surgery. The other can be volvulus, when there is a twisting of one of the segments of the intestine (hence, a segment becomes twisted on itself) on the mesenteric axis. And this kind of occlusion can induce an obstruction. The other one is intussusception, due to an invagination of a part of buccal part of the intestine (in the upper part of the intestine) (fig.11). This type of invagination is due, for example, to the alteration in the peristalsis, in the correct movement of the Fig.11 muscles. So, these are due to the obstruction and these can induce malabsorption symptoms in general. IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) Malabsorption symptoms can be also due not only to physical obstructions, but also to inflammation of segments of the intestine. The main inflammatory diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases in the intestine, IBS and IBD. Irritable bowel syndrome is now considered also as chronic inflammation: only in the last few years this type of disease has been considered a pathophysiological disease. In the past, this was considered only a psychological disease. These patients suffer from abdominal pain, which can be intermittent and they can experience stipsi with diarrhea (there is an intermittent alteration between diarrhea and constipation). These types of diseases, like IBS, are now associated to have physiopathological importance because the action between the gastrointestinal function and the brain function is now physiologically considered: we have a link between the gut and the function of the central nervous system. The condition that links these two tissues is in general is now called the gut-brain axis. Why was in the past considered only as psychological damage and not physiological damage? Because these types of syndromes develop in patients that are stressed. So, they develop especially in the so-called Western countries (in the industrial countries), where the stress, due to the work and due to the lifestyle, is so high that can induce stress into the brain. So, in this case, the psychological stress of the brain, is linked also to the malfunction of the gut. On the other hand, if we have an alteration in the diet (for instance) and so we change, in particular, the bacterial flora (and so there is an alteration in the microbiota) we can induce a functional damage to the Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 18 22.03.2023 BIASI L.2 gut that is linked to the alteration of the brain. Hence, on one hand the diet and the change in the species of bacteria, and on the other hand the stress of the civilization. Therefore, this type of syndrome is considered to have different types of causes and is considered a multiple-probability disease. The main pathological factor, therefore, is the altered gut immune activation due to the alteration of the bacteria present in the gut, which are very important in our body. The increased intestinal permeability, the alteration of the junction between enterocytes and the alteration,due to the diet, of the bacteria, but also due to the continuous inflammation, the intestinal microbiota and the hypersensitivity of the patient. So this is an individual type of sensation it’s not an objective factor but it is a subjective factor, and, therefore, there is the alteration of the brain-gut interaction with an alteration in the autonomic nervous system which is in our intestine: this nervous system is the nervous system of the gut that is able to activate some neurological transmitters, which can be released and can reach the brain to induce alteration in the emotivity and the different type of sensations of our brain. ROME III AND IV DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA To diagnose this type of syndrome we have two diagnostic criteria, which are ROME III and ROME IV (with the latter being the most recent). They are very similar and are associated to the alteration of the sensation for abdominal pain but also to the objective changes in volume of the feces, and the passage of the stools, for example, throughout the intestine and so the motility into the intestine. Recurrent abdominal pain can be a discomfort (an uncomfortable sensation), not described as pain but aa a sensation of feeling not well. Following the Rome III criteria, this type of pain or discomfort has to appear at least three days per month, in the last three months; type of damage must be associated with two or more of these factors, which are the improvement of the condition with defecation, an onset associated with a change in the frequency of the passage of the stool (for example diarrhea), and an onset associated with the change in the form (in volume and in color) of the stool. Following Rome IV criteria it is very similar, the recurrent abdominal pain, on average, has to appear at least one day per week (not three days per month) in the last three months, associated with defecation and with a change in the frequency of stool, number and volume of the stool. Therefore, IBS is a multi-morbidity disease due to different types of symptoms associated also to the behavior, and most of the symptoms are linked to both physiological (such as gut physiology) and psychosocial factors. These two factors are linked by environmental factors: first of all is the change in our lifestyle, in the type of eating, in the type of drinking, but also in the type of living, which is very important. In fact, a gastroenterologist told the professor that there is nobody without inflammation like IBS. Only children are not inflamed during our life, because otherwise our hormones are irritated. Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice 19 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 INTESTINAL DISEASES PART 2 We now finish yesterday's lesson concerning intestinal diseases (IBD). Yesterday we saw the irritable bowel disease that is quite different from inflammatory disease. INTESTINAL INFLAMMATORY DISEASE OR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE IBD are associated with chronic inflammation, Fig.1 response to the luminal antigens (all types of antigens: dietary,nutrients, bacterias…) The two most common ones are: - Ulcerative colitis (UC) inducing symptoms of the chronic activation (acute phase, pause and then relapsing). The main cause probably is the alteration of the immune Crohn’s disease (CD) They are characterized by chronic activation of inflammatory and immune cells, alternated by the remission of the damage. So there is a tendency of having relapses and remissions of the disease, meaning times with acute phase alternated by remission phases. The prevalence of IBD has rapidly increased in Europe and North America in the second half of the twentieth century and has become more common in the countries that have adopted Western lifestyle. America was the first country to have this kind of disorder. Nowadays it is more prevalent in Europe, since the USA are trying to change eating habits (Mediterranean diet ). This type of disease is associated with the industrial environment and thus in a few years the other countries which are now at their industrial onset will have these diseases. The increase in the quality of life induces also the other diseases, like these associated to the immune defense alteration. COMPARISON BETWEEN UC AND CD They are both inflammations, but they differ because of the localization of the inflammation. In ulcerative colitis - Inflammation is in the rectum and can extend to the colon. It affects only the superficial layer of the intestine (only the mucosa and submucosa) - Complications (also in the case of CD) can be structures because they are implicated only in the superficial layer. There are 2 peaks of onset, at 30 years old and the second one at 45 years old. In Crohn’s disease - inflammation can potentially involve all the tracts of the gut, from mouth to anus. It is not just superficial but it also involves the deepest layers (mucosa, submucosa, muscularis mucosa and muscle layer) and thus the complications are worse (necrosis or fibrosis) - Complications are not only strictures, but also ulcers and, while trying to repair, fistulae. The onset is only one and in the range between 20-40 years old. All these conditions are considered to be precancerous conditions, in fact the patients suffering from IBD have a higher risk to develop colorectal cancer than normal subjects. The extraintestinal complications (including peripheral arthritis that is the main complication and hepatobiliary diseases that involve a direct damage of hepatocytes), especially for Crohn’s disease are really important and affect more than 25% of IBD patients. So the therapy must regard not only the intestine but the peripheral complications as well. Another important complication involves the nervous system. It is associated probably with the gut-brain axis and associated with the behavior of the patient. IBD, from a cellular point of view, is a chronic inflammation due to the inappropriate response of the immune cells. There is a time of remission alternated with a time of exacerbation. Exacerbation is the increase in the Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 20 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 immune response and so also in the proinflammatory chemokines. Among the latter TNF alpha (tumor necrosis factor) is the main one and there is an “explosion” of its production. On the surface of the intestine we have mucus with a particular type of receptors for dietary compounds (Toll-like and NOD-like receptors). They are on the surface of enterocytes or inside them and are able to interact and recognize a huge variety of dietary compounds, bacteria, viruses and so on (part of the luminal antigens ). These receptors have the function to present the antigens to immune cells on the basal compartment of the enterocytes. During physiology these receptors can discriminate between “good bacteria” and pathogens but also important molecules from toxic substances. So there is a continuous balance between increasing inflammation and decreasing it. COMPARISON BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION In the human intestine inflammation is a normal and physiological phenomenon; the normal mucosa is heavily infiltrated by inflammatory cells. During chronic inflammation the balance is towards the proinflammatory chemokines or mediators (most important is TNF-alpha, that is also the target for the therapy involved in curing these IBD diseases) compared to the anti-inflammatory (produced by lymphocytes them self to balance the inflammation) (Fig.2). Remember that normally when there is inflammation there are molecules called resolvins which normally decrease inflammation. ENTERIC FLORA AND IBD PATHOGENESIS Fig.2 Inflammation is more frequent in areas with higher bacterial concentration, due to the immune response towards the bacteria in the lumen. During pathology there is an alteration in the ability of enterocytes to recognize if those bacteria are pathogens or saprophytes. Thus there is a disbalance in the tolerance response and immune cells recognize pathogenic bacteria or dietary compounds as toxic, when they are not. There is no correct response. And everything in the intestine can induce inflammation. There is something wrong in the response. Changing the dietary habits of the patient can help to avoid the acute phase of the disease. COMMON CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS IN IBDS - Tendency to familiarity. In some populations, such as in Sweden there is a population with variants/mutations in genes associated to the alteration of the response by the immune cells to the materials that are in the lumen, but also to the dietary compounds (that activate them). Chronic intermittent course High frequency of extra-intestinal manifestations - - Marked efficacy for steroid treatment. Because the first type of treatment must be a steroid treatment and NOT non-steroidal; thus it cannot be NSAID, aspirin, but it can be cortisone. SYMPTOMS - Diarrhea with blood and mucus - Abdominal pain - Extra-intestinal manifestations Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 21 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 DIARRHEA It is characterized by more than 3 evacuations per day, otherwise it is not diarrhea. There is an increase of frequency and reduced consistency of feces. So the volume of the feces increases (feces have a total weight of > 300gr). Diarrhea must be distinguished from: - Pseudo-diarrhea: increased frequency without increasing stool weight/volume. Fecal incontinence. There is an involuntary loss of gas (so evacuation stimulus, without the real - evacuation) and/or feces. Tenesmus (less important than pseudo-diarrhea and fecal incontinence): there is only the stimulus for evacuation (as with fecal incontinence), but without passing stool. ULCERATIVE COLITIS Colitis is the inflammation of the colon. The different classifications of ulcerative colitis are associated with the localization of inflammation and the symptoms (the other classification is also associated with objective values). Proctitis: involving only the rectum (15% cases) - Proctosigmoiditis: affecting rectum-sigmoid colon (35% cases) - Left sided (distal) colitis affects the left side of the colon. It begins at the rectum and extends up to from the rectum to the splenic flexure (40% cases) - Pancolitis or Universal colitis: it refers to inflammation of the entire colon (15% cases). There are four S, which are: - S0 (remission): no symptoms Associated with the localization we have the Montreal classification (Fig.3)-classification of extent and severity. The E is referred to as the localization (proctitis, left-sided, pancolitis) and the S is associated with the symptoms (which are 4). Fig.3 S1 (mild): depending on the number of stools per day ( markers are still normal ) - S2 (moderate) - S3 (severe). It is also associated with bloody feces. Here we also have fever (increased temperature >37.5°), a decrease in erythrocyte concentration due to bleeding and therefore a decrease in hemoglobin (<105g/L) and an increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR, >30mm/h). Hemoglobin concentration is indicated as g/L, while normally its value is for 100mL (g/100mL). The normal value is 14g/100mL, while in S3 there is a very low level of hematocrit/hemoglobin (less than 10g/100mL). ESR is a type of analysis, which in Italian is VES (velocità di eritrosedimentazione). It is the rate by which the erythrocytes go down (in a column with blood), due to the presence of inflammation (immunoglobulins push RBCs down) and also due to the different density of these red cells. In fact, RBCs are in general agglomerated and so they weigh more. In a column with blood the RBCs go down very quickly if there is inflammation. The normal value is about 10, while if it is higher there is a big inflammation. This is a simple and common analysis and it is often associated with the C reactive protein CRP (PCR in Italian). The other type of classification is the Mayo clinic score, associated with the UCDAI (Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (how active is inflammation). Both Mayo Clinic Score and Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index are a composite assessment of clinical symptoms (stool frequency and rectal bleeding) and endoscopic severity. UCDAI gives the doctors the degree of inflammation, if the patients are in the relapsing or remitting moment. Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 22 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 The Mayo clinic score Ulcerative Colitis (Fig.4) is divided in 3 main degrees depending on: Fig.4 stool frequency permeability of the mucosa is altered) physician's global assessment, associated symptoms. also to the rectal bleeding mucosa inflammation: for instance if mucosa is fragile or completely damaged (the Fig.5 CROHN’S DISEASE ACTIVITY INDEX (CDAI) The Truelove and Witts Severity Index (Fig.5)includes clinically objective variables (analysis), such as: -bloody stools/day -pulse -temperature -hemoglobin -ESR= erythrocyte sedimentation rate -CRP= C reactive protein Regarding Crohn's disease, there is only one classification. In this case, it is associated with both symptoms and clinical presence of the disease. Clinical and laboratory variables are dependent also in this case, as with ulcerative colitis, on: - the number of diarrhoeas - The type of stool and its consistency abdominal pain (which is one of the subjective symptoms) - - general well being Hematocrit. Bleeding (specifically, the presence of blood in the feces) induces a decrease in the hematocrit number, which means there is a decrease in the number of red blood cells and thus in hemoglobin. Therefore, in blood analysis we will have association hematocrit, which is useful to understand if the changes in volume of the erythrocytes are associated with some changes in the quantity of hemoglobin. Thus hematocrit considers both RBCs volume and hemoglobin quantity. If hematocrit is very low, e.g. lower than 1 (Fig. 6), it will be associated with hemorrhage, which in this case consists of the presence of blood in the feces (in which we can also detect erythrocytes). On the other hand, depending on the moment in which this classification is considered, we need to understand if among the different symptoms, other extra-intestinal diseases are present. In general the main damage is associated with skeletal muscle– arthralgias (e.g. there is some pain above the muscle) and others that are stronger, like ulcers and gangrene. Depending on the moment and how these variables change, we can assign for each of them a number (weighting factor, Fig.6). The activity index is the sum of all the weighting factors. If the activity index is less than 150, the patient’s disease is in remission. if it is greater than 450, there is a relapse (severe). Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 23 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 Fig.6 CDAI IN RESPONSE TO THERAPY Due to change in CDAI number we can assess how the patient responds to the therapy. If after the therapy the patient's CDAI decreases by 70 points, the patient is responding to the therapy and thus it is working. e.g. starting from 450 points (at the beginning of therapy) and decreasing by more than 70 points in 2/3 months, means that the patient is responding well to therapy. EXTRAINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS OF IBD (Fig.7) shows the main extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. There is a very high number of these manifestations and most of them are associated with alteration of the immune and inflammatory response, so with the alteration of different molecules, which are associated in the maintenance of tolerance in the gut (since they are important to recognize presence of pathogens). Among all of these inflammatory molecules, the key molecule is interleukin 23 (IL23). Another important molecule is the NOD2 receptor. The alteration of the gene NOD2/CARD15 (coding for NOD-like receptors) is well known because it is mutated in various populations. Those with the mutation have a very high risk of developing Fig.7 Crohn's disease. ETIOLOGY OF IBD IBD in general is considered to be a multifactorial disease (Fig.7). genetic susceptibility - different variants are studied to understand if they can induce amplification of the immune/inflammatory response - environmental factors - involved in the predisposition to IBD. Among them the nutritional environment (diet) is very important to induce the development of this disease - Besides genetic susceptibility and nutritional maintenance of the normal layer of the gut and of the integrity among different cells. Two events, alteration of the permeability and changes of microbiota (e.g. high quantity of different types of bacteria) can induce damage on the response. These patients need to have individual nutrition , organized for each one, depending on the state environment, the permeability of the gut is also important. Damage to the surface of enterocytes will result in the alteration of the barrier, in particular in the alteration of the tight junctions which are involved in the of the activity of the disease. A particular nutritional Fig.8 Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 24 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 approach is needed to maintain energy, because, especially in Crohn’s disease, the subjects have difficulty in absorption and therefore it is very important to maintain the well being of the patient. GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY The most important variants associated with IBD are linked to: - TLRs and NLRs - Inflammasomes - Molecules associated with autophagy - Alteration of lymphocytes function, of interleukin concentration (in particular IL23) and of their receptors. NOD-LIKE RECEPTORS NLRS NLRs are inside enterocytes and are involved in the induction of the inflammatory response and in the activation of autophagy. They are able to induce endocytosis (e.g. of bacteria) and to present the antigen toward the deepest layers, where lymphocytes are present. NOD-like receptors are associated with the activation of the inflammasome, which is a complex of proteins Fig.9 activated during inflammation. The inflammasome is activated either towards the induction or the decrease/ regulation of inflammation. TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS TLRS These changes are caused not only by the Nod-like receptor but also the Toll- like receptors which are present on the surface of the enterocyte. There are different types of receptors (TLR2, 3, 4, 9), depending on the type of bacteria that can be linked to them, acting as a ligand. Nowadays, TLRs activation is associated with: - The presence of different types of bacteria The presence of molecules similar to those of bacteria, which are able to activate these receptors. - For example, Gram negative bacteria have lipopolysaccharides which are TLRs’ ligands (in particular TLR4) and induce signaling pathways of inflammation. Since part of lipopolysaccharides are lipid molecules, some lipid sequences of the dietary compounds can be similar to them, thereby being able to activate toll-like receptors as well. Summing up, we can have different responses not only Fig.10 towards bacteria, but also to other ligands coming from the diet. There are possible mutations of different molecules that are involved in this inflammatory signaling. There is a higher risk to develop IBD, ulcerative colitis and in particular Crohn’s disease in monozygotic twins, explaining how IBDs can be genetic diseases (Fig.10). These are all the types of gene mutations which can be involved and that are studied to understand if they are present in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of these genes are: - Associated with the response of the epithelial barrier - involved in microbial recognition - including variations of toll-like receptor and nod-like receptors, and also variants associated to the inflammasome (NLRP3) associated with autophagy ( ATG16L1) - - associated with the immune activation of lymphocytes, in particular T helper 1, and their capacity to produce some interleukins instead of others, in particular IL-23, and also their receptors. IL23R is the receptor on the surface of the lymphocytes. Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 25 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 The main associated mutation is NOD2/CARD15 (nucleotide oligomerization domain/caspase recruitment domain) which induces a defective ability to understand if bacteria and molecules are tolerogenic or pathogenic, increasing the inflammasome activity. THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES (FIG.11) - First approach with anti-inflammatory molecules With not so strong symptoms, the first approach are aminosalicylates molecules, which are not aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). Aspirin is dangerous for treatment of gastrointestinal disease inflammation. Aminosalicylates are like aspirin but the molecule is linked to an amino group, which is important because it blocks the acetic/acidic group of the molecule. The is most common aminosalicylate Mesalazine ( not dangerous for the gut ) - Corticosteroids Fig.11 If the anti-inflammatory molecules do not work very well, and there is an increase in the index of the damage, another therapy is proposed: corticosteroids. If patients do not respond to corticosteroids, the following types of therapy which can be used are:\n\n**Immune modifiers. The most common are thiopurines:**6- mercaptopurine, azathioprine. They induce changes in lymphocyte proliferation and in their response.\n\n**Biological therapy:**\n▪ Anti-TNF-alpha agents. It consists of immunoglobulins (antibodies) against one of the main cytokines which are in high quantities and that are associated with the increased activation of inflammasomes (TNF-alpha). ▪ Antibiotics are used in association with other drugs but not as a main therapy (and also in prognosis) and in presence of different types of infection. There are some examples (Fig.12), which are used depending on how the patient can respond (well or not) to treatment. In the clinical management of IBDs patients are divided into responders (because they respond to the treatment) and non-responders. Therefore, the sequential therapy in IBD (Fig.11) is first of all anti-inflammatory agents, like aminosalicylates. This treatment is for the first acute phase of the colitis, trying to maintain remission. But if this treatment doesn’t work and during the acute phase the patient Fig.12 does not respond, the second step is to give anti-inflammatory corticosteroids orally or intravenously, depending on the gravity of the patient's disease. Then if the patient is a non responder, immune modifiers are used. Finally the last/second line therapy is the biological therapy of anti-TNFα agents.

It is associated with precancerous gastric lesions and progression to malignant phenotype.

Remember that Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are precancerous conditions (especially ulcerative colitis). Therefore the introduction of different types of nutrients is very important. There is a geographic distribution of specific tumors due to the different eating habits and people migration. So there is an association with different types of food they consume, depending on country/ geographic distribution. The evidence on the different types of food we consume is shown by epidemiological studies. There is evidence, that people migrating for example from Asian countries to American countries, and changing their eating habits, will more easily develop the particular types of tumors which are typical of the westernized people, instead of those particular for their geographic side (Asia in this example. They consume green tea with a very high concentration of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds-polyphenols ). East and west have different eating habits. On the other hand, people who migrate to another country, maintaining their food habits, will have lower probability to develop some particular types of cancers from their original countries FOOD INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS ON CANCER There are 4 characteristics, which can interfere with development of particular types of cancers. Qualitative aspect - Quantitative aspect - Accidental appearance (some particular type of damage, e.g. associated with industrial pollution) - Contamination of the food (chemical or physical) - 1. Qualitative aspect The analysis is based on the study of the compounds in the food, which can have direct (on DNA) or indirect carcinogenic effects (if they are metabolized). We have seen these effects in chemical carcinogenesis. There are some examples of potential food carcinogens during: a. Food cooking Smoked or grilled meat is potentially carcinogenic, because during pyrolysis there is an increase of heterocyclic amines and mainly in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzopyrene). They are present in oils and fats due to high temperature of cooking and once in our cells they are able to be transformed by metabolizing phase 1 enzymes into epoxides which are direct carcinogens. b. Food preservation Other chemical carcinogens are molecules associated with food preservation: - Meat, cured meat, fish and vegetable preservatives: nitrates, nitrites, and secondary amines. In the oral cavity, due to the basic PH, nitrates are reduced to nitrites. Then nitrites are reduced to nitrous acid by the bacterial flora. Then the stomach environment, the low/acidic pH, causes the transformation of these molecules (nitrous acid) into nitrosamines mainly, but also nitrosamides, through an enzymatic reaction called nitrosation. Other molecules important in contamination of the food are microbes which can produce the following toxins: mycotoxins and aflatoxins, especially aflatoxin B1 (Aspergillus Flavus, poisonous mold in peanut- based feed). Aflatoxins contamines the cereals (e.g.wheat) during the storage, because these toxins are activated at high humidity, therefore during hot seasons. There was a particular type of contamination in Italy, a few years ago, of Barilla pasta due to Aspergillus Flavus. In general these aflatoxins induce hepatocarcinoma. Also, sub-lethal quantities, so a chronic and not acute consumption of these cereals, induces the development of hepatocarcinoma. Fusarium, another contaminant of the food, is also associated with hepatocarcinoma and carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, like gastro-esophageal carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 27 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 c. Habits of eating - Cycasin is present in cycad nuts (from which the Eastern populations make flour) and induces experimental cancer in liver and in the gut. Cycasin has a pro-carcinogenic action. Actually, it is not cycasin which has this property itself but the active molecule is methyl-azoxymethanol, which is ingested as a glycoside, namely cycasin. In the gut, the intestinal bacteria cleave this glucose freeing methyl-azoxymethanol, so that it can now act as a direct carcinogen. In addition methyl-azoxymethanol can be spontaneously decomposed into methyl-diazonium, which is also a methylating agent and so it can attack directly the DNA. Bracken fern is present in the diet of Japanese people and American Indians. It induces cancer in these populations because these compounds are important to produce the cereals (wheat). The promoting action is caused by the accumulation of molecules in the colon, in the digestive tract and also in the bladder. Especially for the bladder, it induces cancer in cattle, which then humans eat. Therefore in humans this type of diet is associated with esophageal and gastric carcinoma. The actual molecule which is responsible for these carcinogenic damage is pterosin. Bracken fern includes different types of compounds, such as: 1-Ptaquiloside is an indirect compound. It is produced associated with glucose (like cycasin) and it is transformed by the bacteria in the gut, into pterosin, which is a quinone compound with alkylating action. 2-Quercetin is in general considered as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, but in high quantities it is toxic. Therefore the low consumption (chronic eating) of bracken fern can induce cancer due to pterosin. At the same time high quantities can activate an acute damage, by other compounds such as quercetin. Anyway, considering that quercetin is an antioxidant agent, we can conclude that its effect depends on the quantity. Safrole (4-Allyl-1,2-methylenedioxybenzene) is extracted from the sassafras plants in the form of sassafras oil. It is used in the perfume industry to aromatize cosmetics and soaps (not strictly associated with food). It is the principal component of brown camphor oil (in Italian “canfora”). It induces the risk of cancer (liver tumors in rodents; it has pro-carcinogenic action), because safrole is transformed into the forms of acetyl safrole, and the acetic part of the molecule has carcinogenic effect, because it is able to bind to the DNA. 2. Quantitative aspect They depend on the quantity of foods that we ingest and are correlated with overeating and nutritional deficiency. a.Overeating There is a relationship between overeating and the types of fats: e.g. linoleic acid (sunflower oil, corn oil). There is a positive correlation between obesity and the risk of developing a tumor. Some examples are: - endometrium and breast cancer. The adipose tissue is the main source of estrogen and especially after menopause progesterone is no more produced and so it cannot balance the production of estrogen. In particular among different estrogens, after menopause there is the release of estriol, which is very similar to estradiol. Estriol is the ligand to the estrogen receptor and so it induces proliferation. So why is there a risk linked to fats after menopause? Because there are no other hormones which will counterbalance the presence of estrogens (and estrogens induce proliferation). Colorectal cancer is due to an increase in fats, especially: - arachidonic acid, which are so called omega-6 fatty acids and are pro-inflammatory because they are substrates for cyclooxygenase enzymes resulting in the production of prostaglandins (the most important is PGE2), key mediators of inflammatory processes. cholesterol, whose downstream pathway is the formation of biliary acids. So an increase in cholesterol results in an increase in the compounds of biliary acids, which are poly-amides, which have a pro-proliferating activity. Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 28 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 b.Nutritional deficiencies Particular types of nutritional deficiencies can also reduce the protection. The lack of fruits and vegetables intake for a long time will reduce the amount of antioxidants. POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS (PUFA) The nomenclature “omega 6 and omega 3” results from the position of the first double bond with respect to the methyl group (omega 6 because the first double bond is in position 6 from the terminal methyl group). The double bond position can be considered starting from ( Fig.1 ) carboxylic - The initial group (Δ) - Or from the final methyl group (ω) Fig.1 PUFA are polyunsaturated because they have multiple unsaturations. They are called essential, because we are not able to produce them and we have to ingest them through the diet, e.g. through vegetables. They can be transformed by our enzymes, and are called essential fatty acid and must be taken with the diet PUFAs are divided into: - Omega 3, which is considered to be “good”. It derives from the α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3). The main ones omega 3 are: - eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) - docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - Omega 6is considered to be “bad”. They derive from linoleic acid (LA, 18:2). The main one is arachidonic acid. WHY ARE OMEGA 3 AND 6 IMPORTANT FOR US ? We need both omega 3 and 6 (despite one being considered good and the other bad), because they are important in the lipid function in the cell. In fact, PUFAs functions are: - They are substrates of phospholipids and sphingolipids synthesis. Together with cholesterol they maintain membrane fluidity Protein function regulation. They allow for the attachment of receptors and they also regulate - channels proteins, transport proteins. Obviously, they are important in giving energy to the cell (cell energy production and storage) - They are important in the activation/ deactivation of different signals of the cells, associated with cell death and proliferation Inflammatory process. - We need both omega 3 and omega 6, but in our society we have an unbalanced ratio. Because in general the good ratio between omega 6 and omega 3 should be 1- 1 or 4 -1 (so 1-4/1). But in the western diet, there is an increase of this ratio toward omega-6 (so an increase in the fats containing omega 6), with a ratio of 10-15 /1. Omega-3 inhibits inflammation. Therefore, the linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (which are omega 3) are able to decrease inflammation. They decrease platelet activation and production of leukotrienes, which are involved in the activation of inflammation (e.g. in asthmatic production- eosinophilic activation. Leukotrienes cause tightening of airway muscles and the Fig.2 Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 29 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 production of excess mucus and fluid. These chemicals play a key role in allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma, also causing a tightening of your airways, making it difficult to breathe). They also decrease the activation of neutrophil granulocytes. Omega-6 induces inflammation. E.g. Arachidonic acids (substrates for cyclooxygenase enzymes resulting in the production of prostaglandins) induce inflammation and so they increase platelet aggregation, activation of neutrophils. 3. The accidental appearance It is associated with the presence of biological contamination derivatives in food. 4. Biological contaminations Includes chemical and physical contaminants, due to environmental pollution. Environmental pollution consists of: - Presence in food of additives and dyes: azo compounds - Additives in animal feed: hormones in meat Accumulation during the food chain: pesticides and antibiotics (halogenated hydrocarbons), PVC - containers (polyvinyl chloride) - Inorganic compounds in water and vegetables: arsenic, chromium - Substances from industrial pollution: tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. One very important damage occurred in the 70s, in one particular type of industry, which was near Milan, which produced dioxin, and there was industrial pollution and contamination in the environment. (Fig.3) Sums up the different diet-related carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, azo compounds, cycasin etc. Fig.3 EXAMPLESOFTYPESOFCANCERRELATEDTODIET 1.COLON CANCER The importance of diet (type and quantity of food) is especially seen in gastrointestinal cancer (colo-rectal cancer). The inducing factors of colorectal cancer are : - high levels of fat - the type of lipids consumed - low content of diet fibers and vegetables - and in general high fat levels correspond to high caloric intake. Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 30 23.03.2023 BIASI L.3 The protective factors are: - low fat level - types of fat consumed - high fiber content (vegetables, fruits) - low caloric intake. There is a low cancer incidence in countries where high levels of olive oil and fish are consumed (high content of mono-unsaturated acids – oleic acid –and ω-3 PUFAs). On the other hand we observe a predisposition to cancer in those country where omega 6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid) are consumed. The foods to avoid are fats which contain omega 6 PUFA, such as those contained in meat, bacon, butter, sausages, and some particular types of oil such as corn and sun seed oil, which contain linoleic acids (it is not true that all oils contain omega 3, olive oil contains it). Colon cancer is also associated with another type of fat: cholesterol. The latter is catabolized to produce bile acids, therefore the increase of bile acids (ac.deoxycholic, litholytic acid) is one of the risks for cancer development. Bile acids are substrates of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) of colon epithelial cells, which transports and produces a high quantity of polyamides. Polyamides are involved in the acceleration of the progression of the cell cycle (so they induce proliferation). Therefore, high amounts of cholesterol coming from red meat, eggs, butter, also induce the cholesterol catabolism (there is a negative feedback). If we have high cholesterol intake, a part of it from the liver is excreted in the form of bile acids. CALORIC RESTRICTION The low intake of the antioxidants induces the deprivation of some compounds and induces damage by inactivating the defenses. Although there is a particular type of procedure, which is caloric restriction, which is the deprivation for short periods of different types of nutrients. So, there is the restriction in the energy given to the body, that for a short time does not damage antioxidants, but increases the reaction of the cells to the low amount of energy. So the cells with such a short-lasting restriction of energy, adapt to the possible long time denutrition. There is molecular and cellular adaptation. Molecular adaptation is associated to the: (A)decrease of some molecules such as: - PIK3k/Akt which induces cell proliferation and allows for cell survival. mTOR, which is associated to both survival and autophagic process - RAS/MAPK are associated to different types of signals, among which there is proliferation (B)increase of: - Nrf2 - is a redox sensitive transcription factor, because it is activated by a moderate increase of oxidants and leads to transcription of genes coding for antioxidant molecules. When Nrf2 increases there is a production of glutathiones for instance. SIRT-1 – is another antioxidant - PTEN is the opposite of PI3K and blocks its phosphorylation - FOXO- is associated with function of PTEN In experimental animals, caloric restriction inhibits the incidence of tumors (by 24-40%), independently from fat intake. Therefore, there is a change in the subject’s metabolism for a short time and there is a change in hormonal balance, energy intake, decreased basal metabolism, increased immunocompetence, reduced speed of tumor growth. Umberto Geninatti, Fiamma Cusumano 31", "input": "", "output": "what do epidemiological studies say about diet and cancer? Various Epidemiological studies have found that some tumors are “regional” and that the reason for this might be food related. There is a relationship between the types of food consumed in different countries and the specific tumor patterns that prevail in those countries For instance, migrants adopting Western diets tend to develop tumors common in Western populations. Conversely, migrants maintaining their original diets are more likely to develop cancers typical of their home countries rather than those linked to Western eating habits.\n\n**how can cancer be caused by food? (big picture scheme)**\nFood may contain carcinogens made in the process of cooking added for preservation naturally occurring Food may be too much or too little Food may be contaminated by biological agents by chemical and physical agents\n\n**how can cooking become carcinogenic?**\nWhen meat is grilled or smoked it yields polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene) because the fat in the meat undergoes pyrolysis (happens at high temp without oxygen). These compounds are indirect carcinogens. Metabolized by phase 1 enzymes (cyt P450-dependent microsomal enzymes: aryl hydrocarbon monooxygenase, and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase) to produce direct carcinogens, the diol derivatives: epoxide and diol-epoxide. These compounds can form DNA adducts and induce mutations\n\n**how can preservatives become carcinogenic?**\nNitrates (preservative) → nitrosamines (carcinogen) Cured or processed meats often contain added nitrates. These compounds are preservatives, they prevent the growth of harmful bacteria, add a salty flavor, and make the meat appear red or pink. In the oral cavity, due to the basic pH of saliva nitrates (NO3) are reduced to nitrites (NO2), and in the stomach’s acidic environment, nitrites interact with certain components concentrated in meat to form N-nitroso compounds (nistrosamines, nitrosamides), which are potential carcinogens.\n\n**what are foods that contain naturally occurring carcinogens?**\nCycasin: is a glucose-derived glycoside with a methylazoxymethanol substitution at the beta position. It is found in cycad nuts that are used to make flour by some eastern populations. In the gut, bacterial intestinal β-glucosidases free the methylazoxymethanol which is a carcinogenic azoalkane. It can also be spontaneously decomposed into methyl-diazonium, which is also a methylating agent (DNA damage) Bracken fern consumed in Japan, Corea, Venezuela, Wales, etc. It contains indirect carcinogen ptaquiloside, which is metabolized by flora bacteria into pterosin, which is a quinone compound with alkylating action(causes damage to DNA), thus leading to cancers of the digestive tract. It also contains Quercetin, which is an antioxidant, but in high quantities it is toxic. Safrole is extracted from the sassafras plants in the form of sassafras oil. It is used in the perfume industry to aromatize cosmetics and soaps. It induces liver tumours in rodents. Safrole is transformed into the forms of acetoxysafrole, and the acetic part of the molecule has carcinogenic effect, because it is able to bind to the DNA.\n\n**how is overeating linked to cancer?**\nObesity is a risk factor for many types of cancer. There is a positive correlation between obesity and the risk of developing a tumor. Endometrium and breast cancer (especially in post-menopausal women): After menopause, adipose tissue becomes the main source of estrogen production. More fat = more estrogen. In particular Estriol. And there is no progesterone production to balance the effect of estriol which is that of binding the estrogen receptor which induces proliferation in cells that contain the receptor so especially in the endometrium and in the breast. Colorectal cancer high omega 6 FA consumption is associated with cancer because arachidonic acid (Omega-6 FA) is a prostaglandin **precursor. Prostaglandins are key inflammatory mediators. increase in cholesterol result in increase biliary acids, which induce cell proliferation\n\n**how may undereating be linked to cancer?**\nundereating vegetables with antioxidants predispose us to cancer.\n\n**How are omega 6 and omega 3 related to cancer?**\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids are fatty acids that have 2 or more double bonds. PUFAs are essential (we need to eat them because we need them and we cannot produce them) for humans. PUFAs are divided into: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)(an omega-3 fatty acid) from which derive: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) docosahesaenoic acid (DHA) linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) ararachidonic acid\n\n**BOTH types of PUFAS have many useful functions:**\nmembrane fluidity protein function regulation cell energy inflammation\n\n**however ideally we need a 1-4:**1 ratio of omega 6 to omega 3, and in\nwestern cultures with our diets we introduce these PUFAS in a 15-10:1 ratio. This is problematic because omega 6 are pro- inflammatory. (omega is the last carbon and 3 or 6 means it is the third or sixth from last carbon that has the first double bond) Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory, reducing platelet activation and production of inflammatory compounds. Omega-6s trigger inflammation, leading to platelet aggregation and neutrophil activation.\n\n**Fats can act with a direct or indirect mechanism for the development**\nof cancer: Direct mechanism The modulation of enzymes such as desaturase is important. Desaturase transforms linoleic acids into arachidonic acids (and other eicosanoids). PUFAs’ reaction with oxygen producing free oxygen species and so a pro-oxidant environment with polyunsaturated fatty acids intake. Induction of gene expression alteration. Indirect mechanism effect on the endocrine system on the estrogen metabolism alteration of the immune system Modification of the structure and function of cell membranes\n\n**what are examples of contaminations by biological, physical and**\nchemical agents that may lead to cancer? biological: Funghi Aspergillus Flavus produces Aflatoxins (mycotoxin) that can ******damage DNA and induce hepatocarcinoma. Fusarium: Some species produce mycotoxins also associated with GIT carcinomas Helicobacter Pylori Environmental contamination: Accumulation during the food chain: pesticides and bactericides (halogenated hydrocarbons), PVC containers (polyvinyl chloride) Inorganic compounds in water and vegetables: arsenic, chromium dioxin from industrial waste azocompounds in food dyes explain the role of Azocompounds in cancer Azocompounds = contain the azo group (-N=N-) in their structure. Some azocompounds have been recognized as DIRECT CARCINOGENS, associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangioma. In particular, certain azo dyes used in the food industry One well-known example is Dimethylaminoazobenzene (DAB) Methyl yellow or “Yellow Butter”: this compound had been used as a food additive in margarine before its toxicity was recognized Hormones to cattle (meat with hormones)\n\n**explain how colon cancer is linked to diet**\nRisk factor for colon cancer: A low-fiber diet, low in fruits and vegetables and high in fat (especially saturated fat, cholesterol and omega 6 fatty acids), and processed meats and high in calories. cholesterol why? cholesterol → bile acids → substrates of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in colon epithelial cell→ polyamides (they induce proliferation).\n\n**Protective against colon cancer:**high fiber diet, low in calories, low in omega 6 fatty acids.\n\n**how is caloric restriction linked to cancer?**\n\n****\n\n**in absence of calories there is downregulation of proliferative signaling pathways**\nPIK3k/Akt which induces cell proliferation and allows for cell survival. mTOR Rapamycin is a drug that blocks mTOR and ****is used in clinic induce autophagy, which can block cancer growth in the first steps of cancer development.\n\n**In experimental animals, caloric restriction inhibits the incidence of tumours (by 24-40%), independent from fat intake. Therefore there is a change in the subject’s metabolism for a short time and there is a change in hormonal balance, energy intake, decreased basal**\nmetabolism, increased immunocompetence, reduced speed of tumour growth. Prolonged caloric restriction allows for Autophagy (degradation and recycling of proteins and intracellular components in response to starvation or stress) During the early stage of cancer autophagy is protective against cancer. However after tumor development the tumor cells seem to be able to exploit autophagy themselves to produce antioxidants and evade the immune system. In the last phases of cancer, 3- methyladenine (3-MA) can be used. It is an inhibitor of this pathway and so it inhibits the induction of autophagy\n\n**explain how gastric cancer is linked to diet There are 2 types of gastric cancer:**\nLocalized glandular **form: is the most common form, mainly due to Helicobacter Pylori. Diffuse form: is less common, etiology is not clear. It is most common in Asia, where there is a high consumption of fish preserved with nitrates. Its incidence is decreasing in the US (maybe due to increasing knowledge about impact of food in health)the use of preserved food has decreased, while fresh fruit and vegetables available throughout the year is increasing.\n\n**explain how breast cancer is linked to diet**\nRelated to estrogens (especialy in post menopausal women), omega-6 (precursors of pro inflammatory molecules). On the other hand, mono-unsaturated fatty acids (olive oil, oleic acid) and omega 3 PUFAs (present in fish, nuts and in coconut oil), have anti inflammatory effects. A review of the Mediterranean diet and nutritional genomics in relation to cancer in women. Cancer is the leading cause of death among women all over the world. Female tissue-specific cancers are the most commonly diagnosed among women and account for most cancer-related deaths. The main risk factors for women's cancer are hereditary factors, specific exposure to dangerous chemicals, disorders such as hormone imbalance, and lifestyle. High body mass index, low physical activity, low intake of fruit and vegetables, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of cancer screening and treatment are the most common risk factors. Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are both part of nutritional genomics. Nutrigenetics is how a person's body reacts to nutrients based on his/her genotype. It can be used to create a personalized diet, maintain a person's health, avoid disease, and if necessary to sustain therapy. Nutrigenomics studies the impact of nutrition on gene expression and the epigenomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic effects of dietary intake. There is evidence that diet matters for different women's cancers, and is related to cancer progression, survival and treatment. The optimum combination for cancer prevention is a diet rich in vitamins and fibre, with low meat consumption, low milk intake and moderate use of alcohol. The Mediterranean diet looks to be an optimal diet with a good nutrition pattern, qualifying it as a therapy to prescribe.\n\n**substances with anti-cancer potential?**\nphytochemicals vitamins, minerals Riboflavin (vitamin B6) promotes the activity of enzyme systems that inactivate carcinogens (inhibition of tumors induced by azo) antioxidants Alfa-tocopherol (vitamin E) Retinol (vitamin A) and its precursor beta-carotene (carotenoids): inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase involved in cell proliferation and polyamine synthesis; growth factor inhibition and ability to induce cell differentiation “in vitro”. Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C) Glutathione-reductase maintains glutathione in the reduced form Superoxide-dismutase manganese-dependent transforms Superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide Fiber (both soluble and unsoluble) : containing high quantities of non-digestible fibers. Whole wheat and rye flour (25-30 g / day). They change the consistency of the feces, which remain for less time in the intestine less permanence of carcinogenic compounds. Fibers modulate pancreatic activity, and are able to change the transport and absorption of nutrients or metabolic processes in intestinal epithelial cells (caloric intake decrease)"}

The number of cases of dementia grows exponentially up with aging, to 1/3 of individuals aged 80. In general, the clinical manifestations present in this patient are:\n\n**Memory disorders (both short- and long-term memory)**\n\n**Cognitive impairment**\n\n**Personality and language disturbance**\n\n**Visuo-spatial orientation deficit**\n\n**The main clinical sign is the movement disorders (hypokinetic or hyperkinetic movements)**\n\n**Swallowing disturbances:**especially the patients affected by Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease die because of swallowing problems. The food goes into the respiratory system and the presence of it in the lungs can cause bacterial infections like bacterial pneumonia. This pathological condition is known as Ab ingestis pneumoniae.\nThe principal causes of dementia are:\n\n**Degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).**\n\n**Vascular causes:**also referred to as cerebrovascular dementia that can be caused by atherosclerosis in cerebral arteries due to the occlusion of carotid and cerebral arteries so there is this hypoxia and a deficit in brain circulation (ischemia). Due to the prolonged ischemia, the neurons start to die. It can develop also after cerebral infarction (stroke) or cerebral hemorrhages and by trauma to the head.\n\n**Mixed vascular and degenerative problems:**mix of Alzheimer disease with Parkinson’s disease\n\n**Toxic problems (drugs, alcohol can help to increase the dementia)**\n\n**Metabolic causes:**in case of liver dysfunction, one of the consequences of portal hypertension (associated to cirrhosis) is hepatic encephalopathy that is caused by the accumulation of toxic compounds like ammonia in the brain, which can damage the brain and lead to coma. This is because the liver cannot detoxify the blood, so the toxic compounds remain in the systemic circulation, due to the porto-systemic shunt.\n\n**Infections:**bacterial meningitis\n\n**Traumatic causes:**head trauma or boxing dementia because of repeated head trauma (many boxers are affected by dementia)\n\n**Neoplasm:**brain cancer presence\n\n**Other causes:**Sleep deprivation or apnea, radiation exposition or obstructive respiratory diseases (COPD) can contribute to neuronal damage and dementia.\nWithout any doubt, the most frequent cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease: about 45-70% of all the cases are attributed to Alzheimer. Another frequent form is cerebrovascular dementia that consists of 17-30% of the whole cases. Quite often, these 2 types can coexist, and it is called mixed dementia. Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic disorders characterized by a progressive and selective loss of neurons. Depending on the disease, specific groups of neurons with a specific function are damaged, therefore we can consider neurodegenerative diseases as a loss in specific groups of neurons in a particular site of the brain. All the remaining neurons are intact, so we do not have a degeneration of all areas of the brain. In general, neurodegenerative diseases are invalidating because there is the loss of neurons with their Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 66 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 important functions (learning, language, movement) and there is a marked cognitive and movement decline, especially in the case of Parkinson’s disease. While Alzheimer’s disease is mainly characterized by a cognitive decline and ALS is a movement disorder. The common aspect of all these neurodegenerative diseases is the pathological process: the intracellular or extracellular accumulation of protein aggregates so misfolded or mutated proteins which are insoluble and toxic for the neurons (neurotoxicity). The neurons start to dysfunction and there is a reduction in the brain activity because of neuronal death. Sometimes the accumulation of these proteins is caused by mutations that can alter their conformation. Concerning this degenerative disease, we can observe the presence of abnormal proteins that are insoluble and cannot be degraded by enzymes of the tissue. The deposit of these proteins is toxic for the neurons and can provoke the death of neurons (after oxidative responses and inflammation). Sometimes the accumulation of these misfolded proteins occur because the mechanism that should eliminate/degrade them is impaired. The incidence of the diseases progressively increases due to the increase of the age (particularly after 65 years of age), but familial forms also exist. We can distinguish two types of forms: - Sporadic, which appears more frequently in the population over 60 - Familiar form, appears previously, around 40/50 years old MAJOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES:\n\n**CEREBRAL CORTEX DISEASE (Alzheimer’s disease):**called in this way because the affected area is the cerebral cortex (also the hippocampus)\n\n**EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYSTEM DISEASE (Parkinson’s disease):**so called because the neurons present in the extrapyramidal part of the brain are involved\n\n**MOTOR NEURON DISEASE (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis):**here we have death of the central and peripheral motor neurons\nThe neurodegeneration of these patients can already start 10-30 years before the clinical manifestations. Rarely, clinical symptoms appear before 50 years of age. It is very difficult to prevent all neurodegenerative diseases because the neurodegeneration starts many years before the clinical onset. We do not have drugs or specific therapeutic strategies to prevent or inhibit the progression of these diseases. The life expectancy of Alzheimer is 5-10 years. This disease is growing exponentially, and it has been estimated that 34% of the population older than 65 will be affected by this disease in 2050. This type of dementia is growing dramatically. ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE (AD) It was first described in 1906 by the German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer. The 1st patient was Mrs. Auguste Deter and this doctor was able to identify some specific clinical symptoms It is the most common form of dementia in elderly and unfortunately this disease is increasing exponentially. This neurodegenerative disease can account for 55-70% of cases of dementia. The incidence increases with age and doubles every 5 years. Fig.1 This disease is characterized by damage and loss of synapses and neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Because of the progressive neuronal loss, it is possible to observe a marked reduction of the Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 67 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 brain gray mass (atrophy), especially in severe forms. In advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease, besides the marked reduction of the brain mass, there is also a severe enlargement of the cerebral ventricles and cortical shrinkage (bigger sulci). The loss of the neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus area that is involved in cognitive capacity progressively causes all the clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as memory loss (at the beginning, just short memory loss and preservation of the long memory. Then, they start to lose the long memory). Then, language problems with consequent agitation, mood changes, confusion and anxiety. Patients affected by this disease are usually not able to recognize people, relatives and objects. They have language deficiencies and have problems performing daily activities. They lose weight, have sleep problems and at the end they have a marked cognitive decline and death (mainly due to respiratory problems and ab-ingestis pneumonia, due to improper swallowing, so the food can go to trachea instead of esophagus and accumulation of food in the lungs causes bacterial infections). Here (fig. 2) we can compare a slide of a healthy brain with the one of the affected patients. The difference between the volumes can be observed: there is a temporal, hippocampus. Because of the loss of these neurons, we will have the typical clinical manifestation associated with this disease because there is a great deficit in the neurological capacity of the patient. frontal, occipital cortex, and the marked reduction in the brain mass (atrophy of the cortex area) with an enlargement of the ventricles and of cerebral sulci and a flattening of the convulsion. The affected areas are again the Fig.2 CLINICAL SYMPTOMS Clinical symptoms are:\n\n**Progressive loss of memory (first short then long term)**\n\n**Mood and behavioral disorders (depression, confusion, anxiety and agitation)**\n\n**Disorientation (they cannot find the way to go back home)**\n\n**Altered visual-spatial orientation (difficulty in recognizing the left and the right)**\n\n**Confusion in time and place (they could not know which day it is or if it is morning or evening)**\n\n**Agnosia:**difficulty in recognizing objects and also their position (if they are vertical or horizontal)\n\n**Aphasia:**difficulties in pronouncing the names of people and things because they have difficulties in finding the words\n\n**Apraxia (difficulty to do targeted movements, to use a known object)**\n\n**Difficulties in performing normal life activities, movements and using objects (apraxia)**\n\n**Progressive cognitive decline**\nEnd stages are:\n\n**Mute and immobile dementia so they are isolated from everyone**\n\n**Death for broncho-pulmonary complication (most frequent one and the leading cause is ab-ingestis pneumonia)**\nFORMS OF AD We can distinguish 2 different formsof Alzheimer’s disease: EARLY ONSET (or presenile): This form develops before the 60-65 years of age and the percentage is 5-10% of all Alzheimer's cases. They Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 68 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 have genetic origins, and these familiar forms are associated with gene mutations (autosomal dominant disease). The mutated genes are the ones involved in the metabolism of amyloid beta peptides, like the gene encoding for the APP (amyloid precursor protein), protein which contains the portion of amino acids corresponding to the amyloid beta (that in Alzheimer’s disease is aggregated and accumulated in neurons). The mutation leads to the amyloid deposit in specific areas of the brain. Other genes that are mutated in familial Alzeheimer’s are are presenilin 1 (PSEN-1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN-2); these are two subunits of a specific enzyme (gamma secretase) involved in the cleavage of the APP and their mutation is responsible for a higher number of cases of this form of Alzheimer’s disease. APP is cleaved by three types of enzymes: the alpha, beta and gamma secretase. Because of APP or presenilin 1 and 2 mutations there is a high production of amyloid beta peptides that, being insoluble, will start to aggregate and accumulate outside neurons. The APP gene is located on chromosome 21. It has been observed that individuals with Down syndrome, because of the trisomy of chromosome 21, have a higher predisposition to produce this misfiled protein and develop Alzheimer’s disease compared to normal individuals. The pathways through which APP is cleaved are two:\n\n**Amyloidogenic pathway:**the final result is the production of amyloid beta peptide, an insoluble peptide that cannot be eliminated, especially if the mechanism involving the clearance of these peptides are impaired.\n\n**Non-amyloidogenic pathway:**results in the cleavage of APP that will produce soluble fragments so no amyloid beta accumulation\nSo Amyloid beta is the insoluble protein that starts to aggregate forming deposits of amyloid material leading to the formation of the so called amyloid or senile plaque causing Alzheimer since they are misfolded proteins and thus cannot be eliminated by normal enzymes so they will accumulate in the tissue causing neuronal cytotoxicity and neuronal damage. Answer to a question: The damaged neurons don’t spread in other areas of the brain, but remain in the area of the hippocampus mainly, principally associated with cognitive abilities. All the other areas of the brain remain intact. LATE ONSET (senile): It is the most frequent form of Alzheimer, and affects people beyond 65 years of age. It is sporadic and triggered by environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Genetic factors: it has been demonstrated that individuals with the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE) have a higher risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer’s disease: 48% of sporadic AD forms have this allele of apolipoprotein E. Apolipoprotein E is an important serum protein involved in the transport of cholesterol from the astrocytes to the neurons. There are three types of ApoE: allele ε2, ε3, ε4. It has been demonstrated by researcher groups that AD can develop if there is enough alteration of cholesterol metabolism and especially if there are cholesterol oxidizing products. Cholesterol is produced ex novo in the brain from astrocytes: there is a local production of cholesterol because the brain does not use systemic cholesterol, since it can’t cross the BBB. From the astrocytes cholesterol is transported into the neurons associated with these apoE. The ApoE ε4, compared to epsilon2 and 3, is less efficient so is not able to remove the excess of cholesterol. This can influence cholesterol metabolism. ApoE4 can also stimulate production of amyloid beta since this allele can stimulate the amyloidogenic Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 69 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 pathway of the APP cleavage resulting in the increased formation of insoluble peptides. In the familial form there is a mutation of the APP gene on the 21st chromosome. Keep in mind that individuals with Down syndrome have a higher probability to develop this disease compared to the normal RISK FACTORS population before the age of 40 because they have chromosome 21 trisomy that causes higher gene expression and higher probability to produce amyloid beta peptides before the age of 40. In the table, the genes involved in the familial and sporadic form are reported: In the familial form of AD APP, PSEN-1 and PSEN-2 are involved. On the contrary, apoE4 is involved in the development of sporadic forms of AD. Fig.3 Beside genetics, especially in the sporadic late onset form of Alzheimer’s disease, there are other risk factors:\n\n**Environmental factors**\n\n**Age, we live longer than in the past (higher life expectancy) so we also have a higher probability to be affected by dementia of AD**\n\n**Sex (females are more prone to develop it)**\n\n**Smoking**\n\n**Obesity**\n\n**Strokes**\n\n**Head injuries**\n\n**Diabetes mellitus**\n\n**Hypertension**\n\n**Hypercholesterolemia**\n\n**The last 3 are also the main risk factors of atherosclerosis. Therefore, atherosclerosis itself is one of**\nthe risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension can both damage the blood brain barrier and, if it happens, cholesterol and oxysterols can cross the BBB passing the systemic circulation to the brain and accumulating there with a toxic effect. This is the reason why hypercholesterolemia is one of the main factors increasing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n**Oxysterols are involved in both atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease.**\nIn general, all the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (smoking, obesity etc) can contribute to increasing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. CAN WE REDUCE THE RISK? We can prevent the risk of Alzheimer's with a good lifestyle, physical exercise (to decrease cholesterol and lipids, in case of hypercholesterolemia or hyperlipidemia), healthy diet (the classical Mediterranean diet, poor in cholesterol and lipids, rich in vegetables and fruits). It is fundamental to look after our heart to reduce atherosclerosis and other diseases. We have to reduce lipids and cholesterol intake to reduce their presence in the blood. Another key factor is trying to stimulate and challenge our brain , keeping it active by reading and playing games or musical instruments, and doing crosswords. It is also essential to have normal social activities. Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 70 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 PATHOGENESIS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE In the brain of patients affected by AD we can observe 2 distinct pathological hallmarks:\n\n**Extracellular senile plaques (amyloid plaques) that contain amyloid beta peptides**\n\n**Intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that forms neurofibrillary tangles around the nucleus**\nThe accumulation of amyloid beta and tau occurs in specific regions of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. We do not find these accumulations in other regions of our brain, but only in these specific parts. The presence of these plaques outside the neurons and neurofibrillary tangles inside the neurons can contribute to neural dysfunction because the deposits are toxic for the neurons, leading to altered neuronal function, stimulating oxidative stress and inflammation. It is not well demonstrated if Alzheimer's disease starts because of the formation of amyloid plaques or of hyper phosphorylated tau protein but it seems that the deposit of tau is not sufficient to provoke these neurodegenerations in the brain. However, this point is not very clear now. HALLMARKS OF THE DISEASE So, we have 2 formats, the extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles around the nucleus, and also around the amyloid plaques there is an inflammatory reaction because around it is observed that there are activated Microglial cells and activated astrocytes. This is because the presence of the plaques can stimulate an inflammatory response. AMYLOID PLAQUES This amyloid plaque is formed by the aggregation and accumulation of amyloid beta (insoluble peptide). During the cleavage we can have an amyloid beta composed by a sequence of 40, 41, 42 or 43 amino acids. The most frequent peptide is formed by 40 amino acids, while the most toxic is composed of 42. Amyloid plaques are usually present outside the neurons; however, it has been demonstrated that they can also accumulate intracellularly contributing to the toxicity since neurons can uptake amyloid beta thanks to specific receptor complex composed by CD-36 and integrins. APP PROTEOLYSIS Starting from Amyloid Precursors Proteins, whose gene is located on chromosome 21, they are transmembrane proteins expressed on the neurons’membranes. The Aβ portion of APP extends from the extracellular region into the transmembrane domain. The red part in the figure is the amyloid beta portion: it is partially outside and partially inside the neurons’ membrane. The proteolysis of APP starts first at the level of the extracellular domain, later on, on the intracellular domain of the protein. APP cleavage can occur through an amyloidogenic pathway or a non-amyloidogenic pathway. In these processes there’s the involvement of three important enzymes: α-secretase, β-secretase and γ-secretase. The latter is a complex composed of 4 subunits: presenilin 1 and 2, nicastrin and anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH-1). In case of a mutation in presenilin 1 or 2, there is a higher risk to develop the familiar form of Alzheimer. Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 71 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 cutting in the middle the amyloid beta portion (red). As a result, there’s the production of a soluble fragment which will be degraded. The γ-secretase cuts exactly at the junction between the amyloid beta portion and the rest of APP (between red and yellow in the figure). On the figure on the right, we can see APP (transmembrane protein). In normal conditions, its cleavage occurs through a non-amyloidogenic pathway, where we have the involvement of α- and γ-secretase. The former starts the cleavage of APP Fig.4 Again, there’s the formation of a soluble fragment which will be degraded. It can happen that APP cleavage occurs through the amyloidogenic pathway: here instead of the α-secretase there is the involvement of the β-secretase, also referred to as BACE1. This enzyme will perform a cut in the terminal portion of the amyloid beta sequence (not in the middle of amyloid beta like alpha secretase does). Then, γ-secretase will cleave the same portion as in the non-amyloidogenic pathway. As a result, the amyloid beta peptide will be released but it is a not soluble portion: the amyloid beta monomers start binding to each other forming Aβ oligomers. These oligomers start aggregating, forming amyloid fibrils whose deposit will form the amyloid plaques. Depending on where the γ-secretase cuts, we can have an amyloid beta composed of 41, 42 or 43 amino acids. Again, these plaques are toxic for the neurons, and they will cause neuronal damage and death. Besides forming fibrils, the oligomers cause synaptic dysfunction, cell death, kinase activation and interfere with other pathways, causing neuronal death. Here the APP structure with the amino acids sequence with the different cleavages completed by the different secretases: α- secretase cuts in the middle of the amyloid beta portion β-secretase cuts at the beginning of the sequence γ-secretase cuts at the border of this segment. Fig.5 NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES (NFT) The second hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Tau proteins are microtubule-associated proteins fundamental for microtubules’ function (assembly and stabilization of axon-microtubule structure). They are present in the axons. As a consequence of the Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 72 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 activation of specific kinases, these proteins get hyperphosphorylated: as a result, tau proteins lose affinity to microtubules and are no longer associated with them, causing the impairment of neuronal function. This process is typical of a group of diseases known as Tauopathies (all characterized by the accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau). The mechanism of these tangle injuries to neurons is still not completely clear, however it may be related to the fact that tau is dissociated from microtubules and so the neurons lose their function since tau, in the normal form, stabilizes the microtubules. Also, tau accumulation could induce oxidative stress and inflammation. Also in this case, first there are tau monomers, that start to aggregate forming tau oligomers (toxic components), then aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles in the cytoplasm of neurons, that consequently undergo degeneration. The neurons which are most affected by this deposition of neurofibrillary tangles are the cholinergic neurons of the hippocampus, and these are important for the memory, so the damage is caused to the memory. Fig.6 TO SUM UP Neurofibrillary tangles are present inside the neurons and tau is an important protein for the correct microtubules’ function. As a consequence of the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, the microtubule depolymerizes, causing an altered axonal response. All these events are toxic for the neurons and therefore responsible for neuronal death. It’s clear that in Alzheimer’s disease (both familial or sporadic), there are two important hallmarks: accumulation of amyloid beta that culminates in the formation of senile plaques, and the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins leading to the development of neurofibrillary tangles. The accumulation of these abnormal proteins can contribute to oxidative stress and to the chronic inflammatory response: two key events in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. All these events (senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress, chronic inflammatory response) contribute to the neuronal death and to the dementia associated with this disease. These 2 lesions are definitely triggered by oxidative stress and inflammation because these are 2 important processes for the development of the disease and, especially with oxidative stress, we have an increase production in ROS and with inflammation we have the activation of astrocytes and microglial cells contributing to neuronal death and dementia. The vicious cycle of Alzheimer’s diseases: oxidative stress stimulates the inflammatory response which, at Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 73 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 mediators, markedly contributing to the chronic inflammatory response. DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE Fig.7 its turn, will stimulate oxidative stress: they both play a key role in neuronal degeneration. The point is that all the events that we keep repeating work together to stimulate the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Also, microglial cells and astrocytes contribute to neuronal death: when activated they stimulate the secretion of inflammatory How can we recognize if a patient is suffering from AD?\n\n**Behavioral and cognitive tests through which we can evaluate the progression of the disease.**\n\n**Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid to identify the presence of Aβ and hyper phosphorylated tau proteins.**\n\n**Neuroimaging techniques:**CT scan, MRI, PET to evaluate the brain condition. For these techniques we use some radiotracers to identify the neuronal activity. In particular, in Alzheimer’s disease what is used is radioactive glucose associated with 18-fluorine, because neurons use a great quantity of glucose. Radiotracers are introduced intravenously: glucose is used by active neurons, showing the physicians the grade of atrophy, which is the affected brain area and the level of activity of the neurons. Red/orange areas represent active areas, while blue/violet areas represent areas with less neuronal activity.\n\n**Especially in the past, the definitive diagnosis of AD was post-mortem with the histological analysis of the brain with the aim of identifying the presence of the typical hallmarks of AD.**\nTHERAPY At the moment we do not have drugs or any effective therapeutic strategy able to prevent or stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and the other neurodegenerative diseases. The available therapies have the goal to slow down the progressionof Alzheimer’s: they are not able to stop it or prevent it but they can slow it down.\n\n**Cholinergic agents are used to inhibit the degradation of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine which is crucial for communication among neurons but it's easily degraded into choline and acetate through the action of acetylcholinesterase causing less communication and death on neurons. Cholinergic agents keep acetylcholine concentration stable with the aim to increase their binding with the receptors.**\n\n**Anti-excitotoxic agents to inhibit excitotoxicity (high production of a specific neurotransmitter like glutamate); it has been demonstrated that, following an excessive and progressive stimulation by glutamate and continuous excitation of receptors, there can be toxicity to the neurons and they can die.**\n\n**Drugs able to reduce the production and accumulation of Aβ and/or drugs that prevent or reduce the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins.**\n\n**Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs:**to reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory response (present in all the stages of the disease).\n\n**Statins:**useful to reduce one of the risk factors of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, hyperdyslipidemia\nChiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 74 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 and/or hypercholesterolemia, since there is a link between AD and altered cholesterol metabolism —> statins can help reducing lipidophiles from systemic circulation because the brain produces its own cholesterol and bloods cholesterol cant cross blood brain barriers. However in AD patients the BBB is damaged and it's more permeable, allowing the lipoproteins LDL to get to the brain and causing accumulation of cholesterol oxidizing agents. Non-pharmacological treatments:\n\n**Cognitive training:**stimulate neurocognitive capacity of the patient, in particular to improve the ability to carry out daily living activities (stimulate him to eat, play an instrument, do crosswords, have a normal social life)\n\n**Improve spatial and temporal orientation to slow down the cognitive decline**\n\n**Music, art or pet therapies have been shown to be important in the reduction of depression and in the increase of social activity**\n\n**Moderate physical activity:**reduces depression, slows down sleep and food disorders and improves their behavior\nPARKINSON’S DISEASE\n\n**Like Alzheimer disease, it is an age-associated disease and, physician.**\nconsequently, mainly affects old people. It develops after the age of 50-60 in most affected individuals, however, there are some cases of Parkinson’s disease associated with genetic mutations that can appear around 20-40 years. Parkinson’s disease (also known as parkinsonism or rigid hypokinetic syndrome) is a complex group of diseases that can be induced by different factors.\n\n**This disease’s name comes from the physician who described it for the first time in 1817 , James Parkinson, an English**\nFig.8\n\n**Currently about 1-2% of over 60 are affected and 4-5% of over 80s. The incidence of PD is between 8-18 per 100,000 people/year.**\n\n**There exists a mild prevalence in males**\n\n**Life expectancy:**the mortality rate approximately doubles that of a normal person. The death is mainly caused by ab ingestis pneumonia (troubles in food swallowing can result in food accumulation inside lungs).\nFORMS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE We can distinguish two forms of Parkinson’s disease: 1.Most cases of PD are sporadic forms. This neurodegenerative disease is caused by:\n\n**bacterial infections**\n\n**virus infections**\n\n**neurotoxins (acquired through breathing)**\n\n**head trauma (frequently observed in boxers)**\n\n**age (as already mentioned it is a typical aging disease)**\n\n**pesticides, hydrocarbon solvents (trichlorethylene) and toxic chemical compounds, heavy metals**\nChiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 75 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 (e.g., iron, copper, zinc) but also insecticides and herbicides (chemical agents) 2.There are few cases (around 2-5%) of familial PD. In this case the PD is caused by gene mutations and the mutated genes are mainly genes that encode for:\n\n**α-synuclein (SNCA),which is the protein that will aggregate in the brain**\n\n**leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (also called dardarine) (LRRK2)**\n\n**DJ-1**\n\n**PINK1**\n\n**parkin**\n\n**glucocerebrosidase (GBA)**\n\n**others**\nThe result of these mutated genes is the production of abnormal proteins which are folded improperly and can accumulate in neurons. MAJOR GENETIC MUTATIONS Among the mutated genes, the major genetic mutations are:\n\n**Mutations of the gene encoding for α-synuclein (SNCA), which is a lipid-binding protein associated with synapses.**\n\n**In case of a gene mutation (point mutation) we have the production of an altered protein, which starts to aggregate and accumulate forming a specific, characteristic lesion of PD known as Lewy body present in the cytoplasm of neurons. These Lewy bodies are formed by filaments of α-synuclein protein.**\n\n**Sometimes we have a higher production (amplification) of this protein, which starts to fold improperly and again can aggregate and accumulate forming this Lewy body.**\n\n**We can therefore have a point mutation or an amplification at the level of the gene encoding for α- synuclein, located on chromosome 4q21. These mutations are rare but may influence the risk of developing PD. Mutations in this gene more commonly cause an autosomal dominant form of PD.**\n\n**Mutations of the gene encoding Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (dardarine). Dardarine is a cytoplasmic kinase and its name derives from a Basque word that stands for “tremor”. It is observed that its activity can increase during the PD (hand tremor is a clinical manifestation of Parkinson). Mutations in the gene encoding LRRK2 are more commonly a cause of autosomal dominant PD and are also found in some sporadic cases of PD.**\n\n**There are also some mutations of genes encoding for DJ-1, PINK1 and parkin (all mitochondrial enzymes). All these mutated proteins are responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction, responsible for the death of neurons. Mutations of these genes cause more commonly an autosomal recessive form of PD.**\nThe area affected by this neurodegenerative disease is an area known as basal ganglia where we can find caudate, putamen and pale nuclei, which are important for the execution of movements (but not only) so we will have movement disorders. In particular, the critical point of this neurodegenerative disease is the neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of which the substantia nigra is made. Indeed, following the damage and death of dopaminergic neurons, there is damage involving the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. These dopaminergic neurons are very important for the execution of movements because they release Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 76 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 dopamine, which interacts with specific receptors and stimulates the right movements. The loss of these neurons will cause a decreased production of dopamine, leading to movement disorders. The loss of these neurons can start a few years before the onset of disease, which means that there is a preclinical phase with a duration of around 5 years. It is, consequently, very difficult to prevent this neurodegenerative disease. Fig.9 The decreased dopamine level is responsible for an inadequate stimulation of receptors and as a consequence movement disorder can be observed. Another event that can damage this area of our brain is the accumulation of α-synuclein. This protein starts accumulating either because it is produced in a great amount or because it does not fold properly and therefore becomes insoluble (amplification or point mutation). α-synuclein can accumulate in the brain but also in the spinal cord marrow. They can develop dementia. These movement disorders are indicated with the term hypokinesia, which means slowness and difficulty in voluntary movements. People affected by PD will manifest a particular posture (stooped posture and postural instability, they are bent forward) and are characterized by a diminished facial expressivity or “masked faces”, which refers to the expressionless appearance of the individual. Other characteristics include back rigidity (the body is rigid), flexed elbows and wrists, reduced arm swing, hand and leg tremors (which can be present or not), slightly flexed hip and knees, the trunk is bent in front of them. A characteristic sign of PD is also the way the affected people walk (shuffling, short stepped gait). SYMPTOMS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE The disease is mainly characterized by a prominent hypokinetic movement disorder as a consequence of the absence of dopamine caused by death of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra. The main symptoms of PD are:\n\n**An expressionless face (like a mask, “masked facies”)**\n\n**Postural instability (rigidity of the body), stooped posture**\n\n**Decrease in muscle strength**\n\n**Bradykinesia:**slowing down of all the voluntary movements, which causes these people to have difficulty in executing normal movements\nChiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 77 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6\n\n**Festinating gait (progressively shortened, accelerated steps)**\n\n**Swallowing difficulty (dysphagia), which is the reason why most of**\n\n**Sometimes, in advanced stages, some affected individuals can speech)**\nthem die from ab ingestis pneumonia develop dementia (in contrast to Alzheimer’s disease where dementia is the principal clinical aspect since the individual loses his/her cognitive capacity; in this case the patients affected by PD\n\n**Rigidity**\n\n**“Pill rolling” tremor (hands trembling as to count money), tremor in the legs**\n\n**Reduced arm swing**\n\n**Olfactory deficiency, sleep deprivation, sensory difficulties**\n\n**Behavioral problems, mood changes, depression, anxiety**\n\n**Language (speech) disorders such as bradylalia (slowness of**\nmaintain their cognitive capacity until the end and only in a small number of cases they develop dementia). Fig.10 Other symptoms that may be shown are (see fig 11):\n\n**Increased sweating and smelling**\n\n**Intestinal problems (mainly constipation)**\n\n**Abundant and excessive salivation**\n\n**Difficulties in speaking and soft or low voice (especially later on, in the advanced stage) which may evolve in muteness.**\nFig.11 TREATMENT Just like for Alzheimer’s disease, we do not have a therapy to stop the progression of the disease, but we have some drugs able to slow down the degeneration. The severity of the motor syndrome is proportional to the dopamine deficiency (so to the loss of dopaminergic neurons).\n\n**The most effective therapy is a therapy with LEVODOPA (L-DOPA), which is a dopamine precursor.**\nChiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 78 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 Only a portion of this drug can cross the BBB (blood brain barrier). When it crosses it, it is converted into dopamine by the enzyme DOPA-decarboxylase found in dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, this therapy has the aim of increasing the bioavailability of dopamine, in order to increase the stimulation of receptors and, as result, to control the execution of the movements. With this therapy, the rigidity and difficulty in doing normal movements are reduced. This treatment is effective especially at the beginning of the disease, to compensate for the decrease of dopamine produced by dopaminergic neurons during the initial phase, however it is not able to inhibit the progression of PD and it becomes less effective with the disease progression. As a consequence of this, some additional movement disorders can appear and in particular it is common to observe a disorder characterized by involuntary movements (dyskinesia).\n\n**Electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra**\n\n**Neural transplantation**\n\n**Neural gene therapy**\n\n**Administration of neuroprotective agents to reduce oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation**\nMORPHOLOGY The substantia nigra is called “nigra” because this area has dark/grey color due to the presence of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, after the loss of these neurons, the substantia nigra appears pale and colorless. Fig.12 Lewy bodies The characteristic lesions, hallmark of Parkinson disease are the presence of the Lewy bodies in the cytoplasm of some of the remaining neurons. They often appear as a dense core surrounded by a pale halo. These are single or multiple cytoplasmic, eosinophilic, round to elongated inclusions. Lewy bodies are composed of fine filaments composed of alpha-synuclein, a misfolded protein that, due to its altered structure, accumulates in the neurons. Fig.13 Chiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 79 11.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.6 As it has been described in the case of Alzheimer’s disease, also in PD there is an inflammatory response caused by microglia activation, but also proliferation and reactivity of astrocytes because of cell death. Inflammation and oxidative stress are indeed always present in these neurodegenerative diseases. These Lewy bodies can also spread outside the substantia nigra and can be visible in the cortex and the brainstem. This misfolded protein can indeed accumulate in other areas of the CNS and the spread of the lesions is caused by the propagation of the misfolded protein in the neurons of the cerebral cortex. As it has been previously said, a small group of patients affected by PD can develop dementia in an advanced stage of the disease (10-15%); they will therefore show evidence of Alzheimer’s disease in combination with Parkinson’s disease. Dementia with Lewy bodies may represent an advanced stage of PD in which protein aggregates appear to have “spread”, possibly through propagation of misfolded proteins, to neurons in the cerebral cortex. PROPOSED MECHANISMS OF NEURONAL DEATH Concerning the neuronal death, few mechanisms have been proposed: 1.Neurons die because of the accumulation of α-synuclein in the cytoplasm of neurons forming the Lewy bodies; however, the accumulation of this protein is not sufficient for the direct neuronal death 2.Neurons die because of mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal dysfunction or proteasomal systems dysfunction 3.Neurons die because of iron accumulation in the substantia nigra, increasing the oxidative stress and inflammation However, concerning these neurodegenerative diseases (that are multifactorial diseases), all the mechanisms involved in neuronal death are still not clear. The researchers have not found the real mechanism behind this neuronal death. DIAGNOSIS We can diagnose PD in an individual through:\n\n**Clinical symptoms:**in particular we have to observe the presence of the so-called central triad of parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia)\n\n**Neuroimaging:**positron emission tomography (PET), with the usage of radioactive tracers, gives information about the activity and vitality of neurons. In this case the radioactive tracer is fluoroDOPA (administered intravenously), which highlights the dopamine transporter and the enzyme DOPA carboxylase. We can therefore use this tracer to highlight the activity of neurons (their cellular metabolism), identifying in this way the areas where neurons are still vital (highlighted) or the areas where they are lost (not highlighted)\n\n**Observation of Lewy body:**this is used postmortem to confirm the diagnosis of this disease, by observing Lewy bodies in the area affected by neurodegeneration (substantia nigra).\nChiara Rosa, Umberto Geninatti 80", "input": "", "output": "**what are neurodegenerative diseases and their main characteristics? Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic disorders characterized by progressive and selective loss of neurons. Specific groups of neurons with functional relationships are affected leaving the remaining ones intact.**\nMany are invalidating because of cognitive decline and/or movement disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases share a common pathological process, which is the accumulation of protein aggregates (misfolded proteins) within or around neurons (toxic to neurons). (morphologic hallmark of the disease) This is caused by mutations that alter protein expression at different steps. The incidence of these diseases progressively increases with age (particularly after 65) but familial forms also exist.\n\n**what are the major neurodegenerative diseases?**\nAlzheimer’s disease (cerebral cortex disease) Parkinson’s disease (extrapyramidal system disease) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS (motor neuron disease)\n\n**what is dementia? what causes it?**\nComplex syndrome that affects Dementia is a complex syndrome affecting in particular the older population (5 to 10 % of people over 65). The number of cases of dementia grows exponentially up to 1/3 of individuals aged 80. In general, the clinical manifestations present in this patient are: Memory disorders (both short- and long-term memory) Cognitive impairment Personality and language disturbance Visuo-spatial orientation deficit The main clinical sign is the movement disorders (hypokinetic or hyperkinetic movements) Swallowing disturbances: especially in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease mortality is often caused by aspiration→ pneumonia (Ab ingestis pneumoniae) The principal causes of dementia are: 1. Degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 45-70% of all cases of dementia are attributed to Alzheimer 2. Vascular causes (cerebrovascular dementia) 17-30% 1. atherosclerosis in cerebral or carotid arteries, partial occlusion→ hypoxia and a deficit in brain circulation. 2. after stroke or head trauma. 3. Mixed dementia: mixed vascular and degenerative problems 4. Toxicity (drugs, alcohol can help to increase the dementia) 5. Metabolic causes: in case of liver disease one of the consequences of portal hypertension is hepatic encephalopathy that is caused by the accumulation of toxic compounds like ammonia in the brain which can damage the brain and lead to coma. 6. Infections: bacterial meningitis 7. Traumatic causes: acute or boxing dementia (repeated head trauma) 8. Neoplasm: brain cancer presence Other causes: Sleep deprivation or apnea, radiation exposition or 9. obstructive respiratory diseases (COPD) can contribute to the neuronal damage.\n\n**What is Alzheimer’s disease?**\nAlzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disease, meaning it causes the degeneration, or loss, of neurons in the brain, particularly in the cortex, leading to the symptoms characteristic of dementia.\n\n**what is the epidemiology of Alzheimer?**\nResponsible for 45-70% of all dementia in older adults. Late onset (senile): Sporadic Alzheimer (most common): of genetic and environmental factors. Risk increases with age, doubles every 5 years, affecting 1% of people between ages 60 and 65, and 50% of people over age 85. e4 allele of apolipoprotein E gene increases risk one e4 allele = 3x risk two e4 alleles = 15x risk 40-80% of sporadic AD have ApoEε4 allele. APOE helps break down beta-amyloid, but the e4 allele seems to be less effective than the other alleles, like the APOE-e2 allele, meaning patients are more likely to develop beta-amyloid plaques. Early onset: Familial Alzheimer (5 to 10% of cases): dominant gene speeds up the progression of the disease. Alzheimer’s (often progresses by age 40) It can be caused by several gene mutations. mutations in the PSEN-1 or PSEN-2 genes on chromosome 14 or chromosome 1, respectively, have been linked to early-onset Alzheimer’s. These genes encode for presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, both protein subunits of gamma-secretase. Mutations here can change the location where gamma secretase chops APP, producing different length beta amyloid molecules, which seem to be better at clumping up and forming plaques. trisomy 21, or down syndrome (extra ch.21) The gene responsible for producing APP is on chromosome 21, which means that people with down syndrome have an extra APP gene, and presumably increased expression of APP, potentially increasing the amount of amyloid plaque buildup.\n\n**What is the pathogenesis of Alzheimer?**\nAlthough the cause of Alzheimer disease isn’t completely understood, the two hallmarks of the disease are: extracellular amyloid plaques In the membrane of neurons, theres a transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). It’s thought to be involved in neuron growth and repair after injury. The Aβ portion of APP extends from the extracellular region into the transmembrane domain. Just like other proteins, APP gets used and over time it gets broken down and recycled. Normally, it gets cleaved by enzymes: alpha secretase and gamma secretase (complex composed of presenilin 1 and 2, nicastrin and anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH-1)).This chopped up peptide is soluble and goes away without problems, this is the so-called non-amyloidogenic pathway In the amyloidogenic pathway, there’s the action of another enzyme, beta secretase, along with gamma secretase instead, and the cleavage produces a leftover insoluble monomer called amyloid beta. Beta secretase cuts in the terminal portion of the amyloid beta sequence (not in the middle of amyloid beta like alpha secretase does) These monomers tend to be chemically “sticky”, and bond together just outside the neurons, and form what are called beta-amyloid plaques. Consequences: These plaques can get between the neurons and get in the way of neuron-to-neuron signaling. chronic inflammatory response: accumulation of these abnormal proteins elicits an immune response that produces ROS and with inflammation we have the activation of astrocytes and microglial cellscontributing to neuronal death and dementia. Amyloid plaque can also deposit around blood vessels in the brain, called amyloid angiopathy, which weakens the walls of the blood vessels and increases the risk of hemorrhage, or rupture and blood loss. Amyloid plaques can also accumulate intracellularly contributing to toxicity, since neurons can uptake amyloid beta via a receptor complex composed by CD-36 and integrins. intracellular neurofibrillary tangles Tau is a microtubule-associated protein present in axons; it is involved in polymerization and stabilization of the microtubule assembly to maintain the integrity of the cytoskeleton. Although it’s not completely understood how, there is excessive tau phosphorylation that decreases its affinity for microtubules, so it stops supporting the microtubules, and clumps up with other tau proteins, and gets tangled forming neurofibrillary tangles around the nucleus. This elicits 1. microtubule destabilization → impaired axonal transport → impaired signaling 2. stress response → apoptosis Colinergic neurons of hippocampus are particularly affected → memory deficit\n\n**What is the morphology of the Alzheimer brain?**\nThe accumulation of amyloid beta and tau causes cerebral atrophy mainly in the temporal cortex, parietal cortex, and hippocampus. Wider sulci Narrower gyri larger ventricles\n\n**What are risk factors for Alzheimer?**\nAge Gender: major incidence for females Head injury Diabetes mellitus Diseases that impair BBB structure and function Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Atherosclerosis Smoking Obesity Stroke Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a major risk of AD\n\n**1 in 3 cases of dementia could be prevented by addressing lifestyle**\nfactors: taking care of your heart health physical activity healthy diet mental stimulation social stimulation\n\n**What are the signs and symptoms and how is Alzheimer diagnosed?**\nSymptoms of Alzheimer disease appear progressively over time, and worsen as plaques and tangles build up, and damage to the neurons accumulates. In the early stages, symptoms may not even be detectable, as it progresses, we have the appearance of classic demential symptoms: 1. loss of short-term memory 2. Mood and behavioral disorders (depression, confusion, anxiety and agitation) 3. loss of motor skills 4. altered visual-spatial orientation 5. Aphasia: difficulties in pronouncing the names of people and things 6. loss of long-term memory → disorientation 7. late stages: mute, immobile, bedridden, 8. most common cause of death is ab-ingestis pneumonia\n\n**how is Alzheimer diagnosed?**\nThe only definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer’s is brain biopsy after autopsy. Usually a clinician will therefore make a diagnosis after excluding other causes of dementia. Other tools to help diagnosis are: Behavioral and cognitive Tests: to evaluate the progression of the disease Analysis of CSF: to identify the presence and accumulation of Amyloid-β and Tau protein Neuroimaging techniques (CT scan, MRI PET, with radiotracers to identify neuronal activity, etc.\n\n**what is the treatment for Alzheimer?**\nAt the moment we do not have drugs or any effective therapeutic strategy able to prevent or stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The available therapies have the goal to slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s. Non-pharmacological treatments: Cognitive training Music, art or pet therapies and in the increase of social activity Moderate physical activity\n\n**Pharma**\nStatins: BBB is more permeable → LDL accumulation. Cholinergic agents: keep acetylcholine concentration stable with the aim to increase their binding with the receptors. Anti-excitotoxic agents: inhibit glutamate excitotoxicity Drugs able to reduce the production and accumulation of Aβ and/ or drugs that prevent or reduce the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs\n\n**What is Parkinson’s disease?**\nParkinson's is a progressive movement disorder caused by degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the midbrain, which leads to resting tremor, rigidity, problems initiating movement, and postural instability, and for which therapy primarily focuses on increasing brain dopamine. Preclinical phase duration (period of time between the onset of neuronal degeneration and motor symptoms) is not known: hypothesized about 5 years until over 70% of these neurons are degenerated and symptoms become evident. The pars compacta communicates with the striatum (caudate and putamen) via the nigrostriatal pathway, which helps to stimulate the cerebral cortex and initiate and control movement. Therefore, when substantia nigra pars compacta neurons die, the individual may be in a hypokinetic or low movement state which is commonly seen in Parkinson’s. The severity of the syndrome is proportional to the severity of the dopamine deficiency.\n\n**What is the cause of PD?**\nThe exact cause of this degeneration is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 1. Genetic Factors: Some cases of Parkinson's disease have a genetic component. Mutations in certain genes, such as have been linked to an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. However, these genetic factors are not the sole cause, as most cases of Parkinson's disease are considered sporadic (non-inherited). SNCA: coding for α-synuclein, major component of the Lewy body. LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), cytoplasmic kinase whose activity is increased in PD Parkin, and PINK1 (mitochondrial enzymes) 2. Environmental Factors: Exposure to certain environmental factors has been implicated in the development of Parkinson's disease. These factors include exposure to toxins such as pesticides, herbicides, and industrial chemicals. Additionally, head injuries and trauma have been suggested as potential risk factors. 3. Protein Aggregation: In Parkinson's disease, there is abnormal accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies. These protein aggregates are thought to contribute to neuronal damage and cell death. The exact relationship between alpha-synuclein aggregation and neuronal death is an area of ongoing research. Mitochondrial Dysfunction: may contribute to increased oxidative 4. stress and reduced energy supply, which can lead to neuronal damage. 5. Inflammatory Processes: Neuroinflammation is believed to play a role in the progression of Parkinson's disease. Activation of the 5. immune system in the brain may contribute to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. 6. Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra 7. lysosomal and proteosomal dysfunction\n\n**What is the epidemiology of Parkinson?**\nMainly affects people over 50-60. There are some cases between 20-40 years of age. Mild prevalence in males Currently about 1-2% of over-60s are affected. 4-5% of over-80s. The incidence of PD is between 8-18 per 100,000 people/year Life expectation: mortality rates approximately double those of unaffected persons. Death due to ab ingestis pneumonia is double in patients with PD compared to the healthy subjects\n\n**What is the morphology of Parkinson in the brain?**\nPallor of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus due to loss of the pigmented catecholeminergic neurons Lewy bodies may be found in some of the remaining neurons: single or multiple cytoplasmic, eosinophilic, round to elongated inclusions that often have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo. Lewy bodies are composed of fine filaments, densely packed in the core but loose at the rim; these filaments are composed of α- synuclein Inflammation (microglia and astrocyte activation) Some affected individuals have pathologic evidence of Alzheimer disease in combination with PD About 10% to 15% of individuals with PD develop dementia, particularly with advancing age\n\n**What are the signs and symptoms of Parkinson?**\nthe clinical features of Parkinson’s. 1. Resting tremor: involuntary shakiness most noticeable in the hands present at rest and diminishes with intentional movement. “pill-rolling” tremor. Rigidity: stiffness that can appear as “cogwheel” rigidity, there are 2. a series of stalls (stops) as a person’s arms or legs are passively moved by someone else. Rigidity is responsible for the stooped posture and an almost expressionless face that some individuals with Parkinson’s might have. 3. Bradykinesia (slow movement); hypokinesia, (less movement); and akinesia (no movement): result from difficulty initiating movements. Examples of this are having the legs freeze up when trying to walk and also walking with a shuffling gait, or small steps. includes mouth movements: difficulty speaking, swallowing 4. A late feature of the disease is postural instability which causes 4. problems with balance and can lead to falls.\n\n**Non-motor brain functions can be affected in Parkinson’s as well, leading to additional common symptoms including**\ndepression dementia sleep disturbances difficulty smelling\n\n**These are thought to come about because of dysfunction in dopaminergic signaling in other parts of the brain beyond the substantia nigra, for example in the prefrontal cortex leading to cognitive symptoms, and also possibly from issues with other neurotransmitters like acetylcholine**\n\n**How is Parkinson diagnosed?**\nClinical symptoms: presence of the central triad of parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) Neuroimaging: (PET): use of radioactive tracers (e.g. fluroDOPA to highlight the dopamine transporter and the vesicular transporter of type 2 monoamines, and the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase) to highlight cellular metabolism, and therefore vitality and activity of neurons Observation of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra neurons (autopsy) to confirm that the patient suffered from PD\n\n**What is the treatment for Parkinson?**\nThere are teatments that help with Parkinson’s symptoms, although none stop the progressive neurodegeneration. The main strategy here is to increase the amount of dopamine signalling in the brain. Levodopa (L-DOPA): Dopamine itself can’t cross the blood-brain barrier, but its precursor levodopa can, and once in the brain, levodopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase, most importantly within the remaining nigrostriatal neurons. Peripheral dopa decarboxylase also exists, which can metabolize levodopa into dopamine before it gets through the blood brain barrier, and— via additional enzymes—metabolize it into other catecholamines like epinephrine, which can cause unwanted side effects like arrhythmias. This is exactly why levodopa is administered with carbidopa, a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor that isn’t able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Treatment does not reverse the morphologic changes or arrest the progress of the disease; it is able to manage early motor disorders but with progression, drug therapy tends to become less effective and symptoms become more difficult to manage. Amantadine, an antiviral medication that increases endogenous dopamine production, although the mechanism is not clear. Dopamine agonists like bromocriptine, which is an ergot or fungal derivative, as well as pramipexole and ropinirole, which are not ergot derivatives. inhibitors of COMT, catecholamine-O-methyltransferase, which is an enzyme that degrades dopamine and levodopa. selegiline which inhibits monoamine oxidase B, also known as MAO-B, which is another enzyme that metabolizes dopamine. anticholinergics: Since usually there’s this balance of signaling between dopamine and acetylcholine, a loss of dopamine reaching the striatum increases the relative amount of acetylcholine signaling there. Therefore, anticholinergics can be given to restore the balance of cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling, like benztropine, which improves the tremor of PD. deep-brain stimulation, which involves an implantable device that directly sends electrical signals to the basal ganglia which counteracts the aberrant signaling in Parkinson’s.\n\n**What is ALS?**\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons. The progressive degeneration of these motor neurons leads to muscle weakness and atrophy. Amyotrophic: atrophic muscle; Lateral: lateral nerve bundles of the spinal cord are affected (besides motor cortex and spinal trunk); sclerosis: hard\n\n**what is the cause of ALS?**\nGenetic predisposition Excess glutamate (neurotransmitter): excitotoxicity Deficiency of neuronal growth factors Infection of bacteria or viruses Environmental toxic factors (pesticides, fertilizers ...). The prevalence of the disease among farmers is double compared to the general population Soccer players: vigorous physical activity + head shots with the ball + fertilizers (grass fields). in Italy: incidence of ALS in soccer players is 5 times higher than in the general population. Doping is not involved Smoke Prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields or heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury)\n\n**what are the signs and symptoms of ALS?**\nALS symptoms typically develop slowly over time. Early symptoms may include: muscle weakness asymmetric weakness of the hands, manifested as dropping of objects and difficulty in performing fine motor tasks cramping and spasms in legs and arms\n\n**With disease progression:**\ndiminished muscle strength and mass Involuntary contractions of individual motor units (FASCICULATIONS) stiffness → difficulty walking → no walking → paralysis difficulty speaking difficulty chewing and swallowing difficulty breathing (involvement of respiratory muscles) → death\n\n**What is not affected:**\nCognitive activities are preserved ALS doesn’t compromise the internal organs (heart, liver, kidneys) or the five senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) Muscles that control eye movements and those of the external sphincters are rarely affected\n\n**What is the epidemiology of ALS?**\n2-3 cases/100,000 individuals/year Italy: at least 3,500 diagnoses, about 1,000 new cases/year Affects men slightly more frequently than women (1.5/1) The average age is 60-65 years-old. In hereditary cases 40-50 years of age. Rare after 80 years of age Life expectancy: 3 to 5 years; about 10% survive more than 10 years, while 5% reach or exceed 20 years after diagnosis\n\n**What are the different forms of ALS?**\nSporadic ALS: 80-90% of cases Familial ALS: 10-20% of cases associated to 24 genetic loci; almost all autosomal dominant 20%: mutation in gene encoding superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1). Mutant SOD1 protein misfolds and aggregates leading to cellular injury SOD1 protein aggregation also observed in sporadic form 40% mutation in C9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) is a protein of unknown funcition → neuronal accumulation.\n\n**What are the anatomo-pathological findings in ALS?**\nThere’s toxic protein accumulation and pallor of the area Glutamate excitotoxicity Continuous stimulation of glutamate receptors causes a continuous influx of calcium ions in the motor neurons with consequent perturbation of functions and death. Atrophy of the motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord Increased ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, probably due to excessive H2O2 production induced by mutated SOD1. Excessive inflammatory response following neuronal degeneration → glyosis (mainly astrocyte proliferation) progressive skeletal muscle atrophy Loss of the upper motor neurons → degeneration of the cortico- spinal tracts → volume loss and absence of myelinated fibers\n\n**How is ALS diagnosed?**\nNeurological examinations at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia and spasticity progressively worsen Electromyography (EMG) to evaluate muscle function Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the brain and spinal cord degeneration Babinsky sign:\n  \n**What is the therapy for ALS?**\nNo therapy able to stop the process of motor neuron degeneration Most available drugs simply have action on the symptoms or as a palliative. New drug: riluzole is able to slow the progression of neuron damage due to glutamate (excitotoxicity) The therapeutic strategies are mainly aimed at physiotherapeutic support with all the maneuvers needed to allow the maintenance of vital functions Aerobic exercise (walking, swimming, cycling) is important to strengthen muscles and keep the circulation ongoing Speech therapist for language articulation problems It is shown that support with a ventilation device is effective in prolonging patients' life expectancy Gene therapy, use of stem cells"}

In the first part of the lesson, some rules of genetics about mutation (point mutations, missense mutations…) will be defined. I will not ask you to speak about point mutations or other general aims during the exam. However, we are going to repeat them very quickly in order to revise them. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENETIC DISORDERS AND CONGENITAL DISORDERS Genetic (or hereditary) disorders arise due to permanent changes in the DNA (mutations), that most of the time are derived from one parent and transmitted to the germline, so they are familial. Congenital disorders refer to all disorders already present at birth. A genetic disorder can either be congenital, meaning that it is already manifested at birth, or it can develop later in life, as in case of Huntington’s disease. related to chromosomes. Then there are 2% due to drugs, chemicals, radiation ; another 2% are due to biological agents that can cause infections ; then maternal metabolic factors , trauma at birth and uterine factors that represent a small percentage. CAUSES OF CONGENITAL DISORDERS As fig.1 shows, around 70% of congenital disorders are due to unknown causes. 20% are genetic, so hereditary. A small percentage of congenital disorders are due to cytogenetic diseases, so abnormalities TERATOLOGY Fig. 1 Teratology is the study of developmental anomalies of congenital disorders. Teratogens are all the factors that can cause a congenital disorder, for example chemicals, drugs, physical and biological agents, cytotoxic drugs, antiepileptic drugs, alcohol, heavy metals, thalidomide. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TERATOLOGY 1.The susceptibility to teratogens is variable: depending on the genotypes of the fetus and of the mother, there are people that are more susceptible to drugs, bacteria, and other teratogens. For example, fetal alcohol syndrome is a syndrome that appears in the newborns when the mother is an alcoholic. In this case not all the children of alcoholic mothers will manifest this syndrome, because it depends on the genotype of both the mother and the fetus. 2.The susceptibility for the teratogens is specific for each embryological stage. There are specific periods of pregnancy in which the fetus is more susceptible to specific teratogens. Mainly the first trimester of pregnancy, when the most important tissues and organs are forming. 3.The mechanism of teratogenesis is specific for each teratogen. 4.The teratogenesis is dose dependent. The more the teratogen present, the more dangerous it is for the fetus. 5.Teratogens induce death, growth retardation, malformation, and functional impairment. Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 27 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 week 12, is the most delicate. In fact, the susceptibility is higher, because in this semester the CNS, heart, extremities, eyes, genitalia, and auditory system are created. Fig. 2 depicts the sensitivity to teratogenic agents of specific organs at different stages of human embryogenesis. The first trimester, so from week 0 to Fig. 2 THALIDOMIDE Thalidomide is a teratogen that has been assumed by mothers as a sedative drug in the early stages of pregnancy to counteract nausea in the 1960s. In those years, it caused a lot of congenital disorders in newborns, and only one pill, one dose of 50mg, was enough to cause embryogenic deformities in 50% of pregnancies, especially if taken in the first trimester. It mainly causes phocomelia(“focomelia” in Italian, “bambini focomelici”) which is characterized by skeletal anomalies. The arms are short and malformed, similar to seal fins. In rare cases, the limbs are completely absent (Amelia). There may be defects of other organs, mainly at the level of the ear and the heart, but the CNS is not affected, so there is no mental deficit. This drug was banned in 1962 for the use of counteracting nausea in pregnancy. Fig. 3 However, thalidomide is still used in chemotherapy because it induces apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis. In cancer the apoptotic pathways are not regulated, so the neoplastic cells never die, but this drug is able to induce apoptosis and cancer cells. Moreover, angiogenesis is fundamental for tumor growth and nutrition of tumor cells, so its inhibition will stop the tumor from growing. As a result, inhibition of angiogenesis and the induction of apoptosis leads to a reduction of the tumor mass. Due to these effects, also the teratogenesis occurs. FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME Fetal alcohol syndrome is another congenital disorder. It is caused by increased and chronic consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. The susceptibility to the alcohol intake by the mother depends on the genetic background of the mother and of the child. The less severe manifestations include clumsy movements, impulsive behavior, being underwight. Among the more severe deformities there is microcephaly, malformations of the heart, limbs, joints, and also mental retardation. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most common case of acquired mental retardation. If only some of these alterations are present, it is only called fetal alcohol effect, not syndrome. Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 28 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 There are also some facial deformities that make this syndrome phenotypically easy to recognize: 1.small and widely spaced eyes 2.thin upper lip 3.small nose, pointed upwards 4.receding chin 5.corneal damage 6.drooping eyelids 7.poorly developed midline of the upper lip (philtrum) TORCH COMPLEX Fig. 4 prosciutto crudo (raw ham) or unwashed vegetables. The spectrum of symptoms is common for all the different biological causes: lethargy, fever, feeding difficulties, anemia, petechiae. The most frequent are growth retardation , brain damage like microcephaly or calcification , cataracts , conjunctivitis , Torch is an acronym that stands for Toxoplasma, Others (Syphilis, Parvovirus B19, hepatitis, HIV), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes simplex virus. These are the main causes of this syndrome, and the main overall causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. During pregnancy a toxoplasma test is done and if the mother is negative for toxoplasma, she for example cannot eat splenomegaly, and heartabnormalities(fig. 5). Fig. 5 TYPES OF HUMAN GENETIC DISORDERS 1.Monogenic diseases: They are related to mutations in a single gene. For example cystic fibrosis, where the gene CFTR is mutated. 2.Chromosomal disorders: Arise from structural or numerical alteration in autosomes or sex chromosomes. 3.Multigenic diseases: Also called polygenic or multifactorial diseases. They are caused by interactions between multiple variant forms of genes and environmental factors. 4.Single-gene disorders with nonclassical patterns of inheritance: Caused by a mutation in a single gene but they do not follow the Mendelian pattern of inheritance. For example, triplet repeat mutations, which will be explained later. TYPES OF MUTATIONS Mutations are stable, heritable changes in DNA: 1.Genomic mutations: The loss or acquisition of an entire chromosome (monosomies or trisomy). 2.Chromosomal mutations: Visible structural variation of chromosomes. 3.Gene/Genetic mutations GENETIC MUTATIONS Genetic mutations are due to partial or complete deletions of a gene, or more often mutation of a single Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 29 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 base: - Point mutations - Expansion of unstable trinucleotide repeats sequences, of triplets - Frame-shift mutations: due to nucleotide insertion or deletion, and consequently all the sequence of bases is shifted to the right or to the left, completely changing the DNA meaning - Large deletions Point mutations are the most frequent mutations. They can happen due to either a substitution of a base with a different base, a deletion, so loss of a base, or an insertion of a new base. With deletions and insertions, there are frameshifts. POINT MUTATIONS DUE TO A SUBSTITUTION This mutation happens when a single base is substituted with a different base. The genetic information is encoded in codons, so triplets of 3 bases. Each codon codes for one amino acid (3 bases -> 1 amino acid). Therefore, the substitution of a base may have 3 different outcomes: 1.Silent mutation: This happens when the substitution of the base does not alter the meaning of the sequence. The new codon codifies for the same amino acid as the old one. Generally, it arises due to the substitution of the third base. In Fig. 6 this case (fig.6) CCA, that codes for Proline, becomes CCC that still codes for Proline. 2.Missense mutation: When the substituted base changes the meaning, so the code of the triplet, and another amino acid is synthesized. It can be conservative if the new amino acid does not drastically change the function of the overall protein, or non-conservative if the function of the protein is changed due to this new amino acid. Fig. 7 present on the RBCs; this mutation gives rise to sickle cell anemia (in Italian “anemia falciform”). RBCs assume a particular shape that resembles a sickle (“falce,” shown in fig.8 ), and become rigid, which can cause them to remain trapped inside small vessels where they In this case (fig.7) CTC becomes CAC and the codon that normally codifies for Glutamic acid now codes for Valine. This is a missense mutation that occurs in the globin-β that is a part of hemoglobin are destroyed. This is an example of hemolytic anemia. Fig. 8 3.Nonsense mutation: When the substitution of the base brings to the creation of a stop codon, so the protein will be smaller and Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 30 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 Fig. 9 can be useful to revise some concepts. Let's imagine a normal protein, composed of 4 amino acids (aa): Arginine, Leucine, Proline, and Isoleucine. Every aa is codified by a triplet, so the three bases of Arginine are CGG, Leucine is TTA… Second line is a missense mutation, so a point mutation with a substitution of a thymine with cytosine. This substitution brings to the formation of another triplet, TCA that codifies for Serine, and the resulting protein is different. The third line is a nonsense mutation, so a mutation in which the substitution of thymine with adenine brings to the formation of a TAA codon, which is a stop codon. The protein that will be synthesized will be truncated (shortened), and most probably degraded. The last two are examples of frame-shift mutations. The insertion of a single base leads to a complete shift of the meaning of the DNA to the right. So, if Fig. 9 the DNA codons are read, 3 bases at time, all the aa here are different: Phenylalanine, Threonine, Aspartate. In the case of a deletion of the thymine base, the message is shifted to the left and the aa are Tyrosine, Arginine and Leucine. The frame-shift mutations can have huge and devastating effects on the proteins, as it drastically changes all the aa downstream from the mutation site, and thus the resulting proteins are completely different. POINT MUTATIONS DUE TO A DELETION OR INSERTION If the bases that are deleted or inserted are a multiple of 3 there are no real differences in the DNA message, because some aa are inserted or deleted but the others remain normal. Fig.10 is an example of the deletion of 3 bases that codify for Phenylalanine in the gene coding for CFTR– a channel for chloride. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease in which the main mutation is the deletion of Phenylalanine that brings to the alteration in this CFTR protein. Due to this mutation the protein is not able to reach the plasma membrane after being synthesized. It is similar to the native protein, but it remains trapped in the Golgi or ER. Because of that, CFTR will be missing from the surface of exocrine glands, and the clinical manifestations of cystic Fig. 10 fibrosis are due to the lack of these channels on the surface of the exocrine glands. Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 31 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 If the bases inserted or deleted are not a multiple of 3 (so 1,2,4…), it is a frame-shift mutation, so the whole DNA information is shifted to the left or to the right and lots of aa are completely changed. In fig.11 four bases (TATC) are inserted, which results in a frame shift to the right and the reading frame is completely changed. This happens in Tay-Sachs disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease with lysosome accumulation in cells. TRINUCLEOTIDE-REPEAT MUTATIONS Fig. 11 Another type of mutations are trinucleotide-repeat mutations, in which a codon is repeated too many times in the DNA. In general, they involve repetitions of triplets which contain C or G. There are a lot of diseases related to that mutation, for example Huntington disease and X fragile syndrome. HUNTINGTON DISEASE (HD) HD, also called chorea of Huntington, is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a severe damage of the cerebral cortex that also extends to the basal ganglia. It is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease. It arises due to a pathological repetition of CAG triplets. In a normal brain, there are already 10 – 30 repetitions of CAG triplets, but sometimes these repetitions start repeating too many times later in life, which will lead to the development of Huntington’s disease. The main clinical manifestations involve the alteration of movements and balance, the patients move involuntarily and lose balance, which looks similar to dancing. Neurodegenerative diseases in general arise due to an accumulation of proteins in cells, more specifically in neurons, which leads to a progressive degeneration. This is true for HD, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS, or Tay-Sachs. It is a genetic disorder but not congenital, so the patients are not born with it. It manifests in patients from 30 to 45 years old and it is a chronic progressive The brain of patients with HD is atrophic, and looks smaller and lighter. This is because of the death of neurons that are permanent cells, so once they are dead, they cannot regenerate, and there is deficient brain tissue. (fig.12) disorder that brings death around 15 years from onset. Fig. 12 Nowadays there are tests able to measure the number of repeats of codons in Huntington disease, but there are a lot of discussions about the ethical impact of these tests, because usually at the age of 30/40, people already have children, and there is no cure for it. CAG triplet codes for glutamic acid and when there is an expansion of the CAG triplet inside the gene, it codes for a protein called huntingtin. Normally huntingtin is a ubiquitous protein in the body, mainly presenting at the level of the brain, where it is neuroprotective (protects neurons from dying). However, in case of an abnormal CAG repetition, the new huntingtin protein will have a long polyglutamic tract, which will cause the protein to lose its neuroprotective properties and becomes toxic for the neurons. This neurotoxic huntingtin will accumulate especially at the level of cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, leading to progressive degeneration of these areas. Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 32 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 Q: Why is it accumulating specifically in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia? A: We do not know. The research in HD is not as progressed. Involuntary movements will affect all body segments, so from a certain point of progression, the clinical manifestations will involve bizarre grimaces, sudden movements of the upper limbs, difficulty walking (similar to a dance), difficulty the most basic performing movements necessary for everyday life, dysarthria (difficulty speaking), inability to swallow due to uncoordinated movements of the pharyngo-laryngeal musculature, and dementia. The more the disease develops, the more the cognitive functions and Fig. 13 the common movement abilities are affected. Fig.13 shows the age of the patients and the functional abilities of the patient that start to decrease significantly at the age of 45. Moreover, there is an inverse relationship between the number of CAG repeats and the age of the onset. The higher the number of the repeats is, the earlier is the age of onset that involves abnormalities in muscle coordination, psychomotor and cognitive functions. After the pathological repetition of CAG, the toxic huntingtin will first aggregate into oligomers, and then into fibrils, which will precipitate inside the cell. The aggregated toxic huntingtin accumulates both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. The accumulation of this abnormal huntingtin in the nucleus causes the expression of genes that are not normally expressed in neurons and cause mitochondrial toxicity, synaptic dysfunctions, and axonal transport impairments. In this sense they become more and more susceptible to oxidative stress. When there is cell necrosis, consequently there is also inflammation and with inflammation comes oxidative stress, mainly because of neutrophils. This oxidative stress becomes dangerous, and it is a vicious cycle that leads to the progressive neurodegeneration and cell death. Fig. 14 Q: Why is the presence of these triplets not dangerous at the beginning? A: Because if you have a small repetition the polyglutamic tract is not too long to cause an alteration of the function, it is not sufficient to change the function of the protein. As of January 2023, there are no approved disease-modifying treatment. Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 33 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 FRAGILE X SYNDROME Fragile X syndrome is another disease caused by the expansion of a triplet. In this (familial mental retardation protein). FMRP is important for neuronal development, so same as huntingtin, it is a prosurvival, neuroprotective and pro-developmental protein. When there is an expansion of the trinucleotide triplet case the triplet is CGG, which codes for Arginine. The problem in this case is the expansion of this sequence at the level of the FMR1 gene encoding for FMRP Fig. 15 inside the gene coding for FMR1, the protein becomes toxic, loses the ability to protect neurons and this leads to mental retardation. The severity of the manifestations depends on the level of the expansion. It is a mutation specifically related to the X chromosome. The expansion of this triplet brings to two fragile sites at the level of the long arm of the X chromosome - for that reason it is called fragile X syndrome. As the mutation is located on the X chromosome, the transmission is x-linked, not following the classical Mendelian inheritance. Moreover, it is a dynamic mutation, meaning that subsequent generations have greater genetic damage. Fig. 16 Fig.16 shows how a family tree can be affected in case of a male carrier. The first generation of children is characterized by the fact that all the males are healthy, without any mutation present. Instead, the daughters are normal but have the premutation inherited from the father, because the X chromosome of the father goes to the daughter. They are not really affected because women have another healthy X chromosome from the mother, and even in the affected chromosome from the father the repetition is not as high to cause the syndrome. Talking about the children of a carrier daughter, the granddaughters have a higher expansion of the trinucleotide, because over the generation this mutation increases, so they have a full mutation, but they are usually normal, due to the presence of the other X chromosome. Only 50% of these females will be affected, and only mildly. Instead, the grandsons have a fully mutated X chromosome, and they are affected by the disorder, because they only have one X, in which there are two fragile sites in which Arginine is altered. macro-orchidism in males. They have also some behavioral characteristics, such as stereotyped movements , atypical social development , shyness , and autism . People with fragile X syndrome have some typical physical characteristics, including a high forehead, a long face with a large mandible, a large nose, thin or retracted lips, large everted ears, and Fig. 17 Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 34 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 synaptic function and for that reason the neurons die. FMRP is most abundant in brain and testes and that is why these two organs are affected the most. FMRP is able to bind mRNA and transport this mRNA into synapses. If this protein is mutated it is no longer able to bind mRNA necessary for the Genetic diseases involving a mutation in only one gene are typically Fig. 18 transmitted as either autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked. AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT DISORDERS Autosomal dominant disorders manifest already in a heterozygous state, because only one mutated allele is sufficient to cause the disease. Fig.19 shows a model of inheritance in case of one heterozygous parent, healthy child, and 50% to have a sick one. While if both parents are heterozygous and affected by the disease, there is a 25% probability to have two mutated alleles. This condition is usually, but not therefore affected by the disease. A mutation in one allele of the gene is sufficient to cause the disease. Overall, there is a 50% probability to have a always, not compatible with life. This model of inheritance is later shown in Fig. 19 fig.22. Some examples of autosomal dominant disorders are listed in fig.20. Fig. 20 ACHONDROPLASIA disarmonico”), because the head is very big with a prominent forehead, saddle nose, but the limbs are very short. Achondroplasia, “nanismo” in Italian, is the most frequent from a group of genetic osteochondrodysplasias. It affects the development of chondroblasts of the epiphysis of long bones. Achondroplasia is disharmonic dwarfism (“nanismo Fig. 21 Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 35 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 The mutation is on chromosome 4, on a gene coding for the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 (FGFR3). It is a receptor present on fibroblasts, and in case of its absence, fibroblasts cannot bind the growth factor. It is not a structural protein, but a receptor protein that is lacking or not functioning pregnancy, and 50% probability to have a child affected by disharmonic dwarfism. Fig.22 is an example of both parents affected. There is a 25% probability to have a healthy child, so tall and not affected, another 25% probability of death during It affects the development of chondroblasts of epiphyses of long bones. The Fig. 22 average height for affected males is 130cm, and for females it is 125cm. The intelligence is not affected at all. OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA syndrome and syndrome. Osteogenesis imperfecta, also called “glass bone” disease, is autosomal disease. It is an autosomal dominant another Marfan There are some disorders that are characterized by mutations in genes coding for structural proteins, for example osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos Fig. 23 dominant disorder characterized by mutations in the gene coding for type I collagen. It has 8 types, but all are characterized by defective synthesis of type I collagen. The types depend on whether the mutation of the gene causes a complete absence of the protein, or a defective function of coding for fibrillin-1, the name of the gene is FBN1. Fibrillin-1 is an extracellular glycoprotein of the connective tissue which forms the microfibrils of the extracellular matrix, especially in tendons and walls of big vessels. Therefore, in the case of a mutation, there will be problems related mostly with the tendons, big vessels (aorta) and eyes. One third of the cases is caused by sporadic mutations, arising de novo. There are different forms, phenotypes, and consequently different severity of the disease. There are people that only manifest phenotypic characteristics, usually they are very tall with Fig. 24 the protein. Type II is not compatible with life. In osteogenesis imperfecta bones are too little, fragile, deformed, and multiple spontaneous fractures may occur. Dental problems, ocular problems and hearing loss are also present. In short, it impacts tissues rich in type I collagen (joints, eyes, ears, skin, and teeth). MARFAN SYNDROME Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a mutation in the gene Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 36 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 long arms, hands, and legs. It can also be characterized by spider fingers, which are abnormally long fingers and toes (shown in fig.25). The ligaments of the hands and of the feet are lax and hyperextensible. Spinal deformities may be present, as well as deformities of the chest, such as pectus excavatum, in which the sternum is deeply depressed and the pigeon-breast deformity, in which the chest is external. So the main problems are related to the skeletal system. However, it is important to recognize and diagnose Marfan syndrome, for example in really tall people (basketball players, volleyball people), as the problems related to Marfan syndrome are not only related to the skeletal system. Ocular changes are frequently present, for example a typical mark of the disease is the bilateral dislocation of the lens, Fig. 25 called ectopia lentis. Severe myopia or retinal detachment can also be present. Most importantly, Marfan syndrome can cause cardiovascular lesions. Overall, aorta is very lax and fragile, which may lead to a dilation of aorta and subsequently aortal aneurysm. This is the cause of death in around 30% of patients due to the internal hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock caused by the aneurysm. The therapy consists of drugs that protect against aortic dilation, drugs against hypertension, or a surgical insertion of an aortal stent. Fig. 26 Normally, fibrillin-1 regulates the function of TGFβ. When fibrillin is present, TGFβ is trapped in fibrillin, and it is released only when it is necessary. While in Marfan syndrome, when fibrillin-1 is lacking, TGFβis overactivated (because it is free from fibrillin), and it binds to the TGFβ receptor, present on the surface of the plasma membrane, stimulating the downstream pathways (SMAD proteins and so on). SMAD proteins translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs are overproduced and degrade the extracellular matrix. It is a vicious cycle: lack of fibrillin-1 causes overproduction of MMPs which further degrade ECM. There are 6 variants of EDS. The affected tissues are those that are rich in collagen: skin, joints, ligaments . The skin becomes hyperextensible, and the joints are hyperflexible, as can be seen in fig.27 . Apart from these typical characteristics, there can be some other serious consequences, since collagen is also present in organs. For example, there can be hyperelasticity and fragility of the skin, delayed wound healing, joint hypermobility and joint dislocation, rupture of arteries, intestines and uterus EHLER-DANLOS SYNDROMES (EDS) This is a wide spectrum of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders belonging to the autosomal dominant disorders. It is defined as a group of diseases because there are different features of the disease depending on the type of mutation. EDS belong is caused by a mutation on a gene coding for type I, III and V collagen. during pregnancy, eye injuries and blindness, skeletal deformities, and Fig. 27 Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina 37 16.03.2023 GAMBA L.3 periodontal diseases (loss of teeth within 30 years of age). The most severe internal complications that may occur are the rupture of the colon and large arteries, ocular fragility with rupture of cornea and retinal detachment and diaphragmatic hernia. Because of these dangerous complications, it is important to recognize this disorder as soon as possible and prevent the complications. FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA The main cause of familial hypercholesterolemia is a mutation at the level of the gene coding for LDL receptors (LDLR), located on the surface of hepatocytes. Lipoproteins are the particles that carry lipids in blood because lipids cannot freely flow in blood due to their hydrophobic properties. Lipids need to be carried by proteins, otherwise they would aggregate immediately and form a lipid embolus. In hypercholesterolemia there is a high level of LDL (low density lipoproteins) in blood. LDL are also called “bad cholesterol,” because they carry lipids from liver (where lipids are synthetized) to the peripheral tissues. If the level of LDL gets too high, they accumulate inside arterial walls, giving rise to atherosclerosis. On the other side, HDL (high density lipoproteins) are also called the “good cholesterol,” as they carry lipids from the periphery to the liver, where these lipids are recycled. Therefore, the more HDL a person has, the better. And the more LDL a person has, the worse. It is called hypercholesterolemia, even though it is an increase in LDL, because the main component of LDL is cholesterol. If the LDLR on the hepatocytes surface is not present or not properly working, LDL are not taken up by the liver and they remain in the bloodstream. For this reason, the levels of LDL are very high in those patients. In familial hypercholesterolemia there are different clinical manifestations, from milder to severe. It is again an autosomal dominant disease. In heterozygous patients there are elevated plasma cholesterol levels even at birth (around 350 mg/dL), tendon xanthomas (accumulation of cholesterol at the level of tendons) before the age of 30, early atherosclerosis, leading to a coronary artery disease before the age of 40. In homozygous patients the mutation is still compatible with life, but the manifestations are worse. The levels of plasma cholesterol are higher (from 600 to 1200 mg/dL), the patients can have cutaneous and tendon xanthomas, coronary atherosclerosis can occur even in pediatric age, and myocardial infarction even before the age of 30. Q: What is the correct concentration of LDL cholesterol? A: About 120 mg/dL in normal people. In people with risk factors or subjects that have undergone a myocardial infarction that take drugs to reduce cholesterol levels, the ideal concentration is 50 mg/dL. This is what LDL looks like (fig.28). In the center there are cholesterol esters, then cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. The hydrophilic part surrounds the hydrophobic center. A protein called ApoB100 wraps around the LDL particle and can bind to LDLR on the surface of the liver. Hojsíková Alžbeta, Saghafi Romina Fig. 28 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 GENETIC DISORDERS PART 2 FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA It’s a disorder that can have many different causes. Mutation of the gene coding for LDL receptor The main one is a mutation at the level of the gene coding for the LDL (low density lipoproteins) receptor, which is mainly located on the surface of hepatocytes and has the role of binding and keeping LDL out of the circulation. This receptor is involved in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol, as LDL are the particles that carry lipids in the bloodstream as they cannot freely flow in it due to their hydrophobic properties. The LDL receptor is also present on the surface of the cells of the periphery, as LDL goes from the liver to the periphery in order to bring cholesterol to the cells that synthesize steroid hormones, form new cell membranes, or that may need it for other uses. It is important to keep in mind the difference between LDL (bad cholesterol, takes cholesterol from the liver and brings it to the peripheric cells) and HDL (good cholesterol, takes cholesterol from the peripheric cells and brings it to the liver), which are different in the structure, even if both are lipoproteins that allow lipids to flow in the blood. Overall, familial hypercholesterolemia is due to the lack of the LDL receptor in hepatocytes and a manifestation of high levels of LDL concentration on blood. The physiological amount of LDL is about 120 mg/dL in normal people, while in people with risk factors or subjects that have undergone a myocardial infarction that take drugs to reduce cholesterol levels, the ideal concentration is 50 mg/dL. Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder so both heterozygous and homozygous present the disease, with the homozygous manifest more severe symptoms. In heterozygous patients have elevated plasma cholesterol levels even at birth (around 350 mg/dL), tendon xanthomas (accumulation of cholesterol at the level of tendons) before age 30, early atherosclerosis (chronic inflammatory disorder that arises at the level of the medium and big arteries, mainly caused by elevated levels of plasmatic LDL, which penetrates in the intima of these arteries and forms atherosclerotic plaques that cause occlusions). In homozygous patients the levels of plasma cholesterol go from 600 to 1200 mg/dL, the patients can have cutaneous and tendon xanthomas, coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction even before the age of 30. Other mutations Mutations of LDL receptors are the main cause, but there are other genetic conditions that can lead to familial hypercholesterolemia. For example, in 10-15% of hypercholesterolemia cases are mutations at the level of the gene of the apolipoprotein B100 (Apo-B100), the protein that surrounds LDL. Considering that LDLR on the surface of hepatocytes specifically recognizes Apo-B100, a mutation leads to the lack of the binding between the receptor and the protein. In other cases (2-5%) there can be a mutation at the level of the protein PCSK9 that regulates the recycling of LDLR. Treatment To reduce the concentration of LDL in blood the drugs that are given are statins. Statins, however, have lots of side effects. Some people can’t sustain their intake because of the side effects like muscle pain. For those subjects there are some new drugs: specific antibodies against PCSK9. By binding PCSK9 these antibodies prevent the recycle of the LDLR, which remains on the surface of hepatocytes, allowing to keep more LDL away from the blood circulation. Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 39 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 In the cases in which antibodies have to be administered, cardiologists aim to reach 50 mg/dL of LDL because these patients are at risk of myocardial infarction. Remember that LDL levels increase also due to a lipid rich diet, so a correction in alimentation would be enough to bring LDL levels back to normal ranges. LDL STRUCTURE (fig.1) In the centre of an LDL there are cholesterol esters, then cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides. All of them have to be carried in the bloodstream and to do so they need the ApoB100, which is a protein that wraps around the LDL particle and that can bind to LDLR on the surface of the liver. fig.1 LDL receptors are also present in the brain, in the skin. LDL METABOLISM Figure 2 depicts an hepatocyte with a LDLR, but it also shows that the liver is able to create VLDL too (very low- density lipoproteins), that are mainly composed of triglycerides (the yellow part in the figure) and a small amount of esterified cholesterol. VLDL have 3 Apo proteins on their surface: ApoC, ApoB and ApoE. VLDL are useful because triglycerides are used by muscles for energy and by adipocytes for their storage and this is possible thanks to the action of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase that separates triglycerides from the rest of the lipoprotein. The consequence is the creation of IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein) that have lost ApoC and are left with only ApoE and ApoB. 50% of IDL goes back to the liver where it binds the LDLR, which specifically recognizes B100, and the components of these IDL are recycled. The other 50% of IDL loses the remaining triglycerides and becomes LDL. HDL takes cholesterol from the periphery where it is in excess, and it shuttles it to the hepatocytes where it is fig.2 recycled, starting a new cycle. So, if the LDL receptor is not present on the cell’s surface, either of or hepatocytes or peripheric cells, or if it’s present in lower amounts, LDL remains in the bloodstream. fig.3 In this figure (fig.3), it is possible to see LDLR on the surface of hepatocytes that bind LDL, clathrin-coated vesicles are created, and they fuse with lysosomes. LDLR is recycled, so it goes back to the surface, LDL is degraded, APO-B100 is degraded in amino acids, and cholesterol exits from the lysosome to reach the cytoplasm to be recycled. In order for the cholesterol to exit the lysosome two main proteins present at the level of the lysosomes are needed: NPC1 and NPC2 (NP stands for Niemann-Pick). Once cholesterol reaches the cytoplasm, it regulates several pathways as it has a lot of physiological functions. Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 40 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 However, when cholesterol levels are too high, cholesterol inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol, with negative feedback. In particular, it inhibits the main rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis which is HMG CoA reductase and so the synthesis of cholesterol is reduced. Moreover, cholesterol activates the enzymes necessary to create cholesterol esters. Another way to inhibit cholesterol accumulation is the inhibition of the gene expression and synthesis of LDLR. In this way LDLR are not synthesized ex novo and on the surface of hepatocytes the level of LDLR is reduced. = Three separate processes are affected by the released intracellular cholesterol: 1) Cholesterol suppresses cholesterol synthesis within the cell by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, which is the ratelimiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway. 2) Cholesterol activates the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase, favoring esterification and storage of excess cholesterol. 3) Cholesterol suppresses the synthesis of LDL receptors, thus protecting the cells from excessive accumulation of cholesterol. Q: So we have production of lipids other than cholesterol but we don’t have their secretion, right? A: Yes, we have the production of other lipids but cholesterol is particularly able to regulate its own production Depending on the type of mutation of the gene mutate, there are different outcomes (fig.4). There are more than 150 mutations of the gene coding for LDLR. There can be some other mutations at the level of the LDLR gene that still allow the protein to be synthesized, to be transported to the cell’s surface but the protein doesn’t work properly. This might be due to an abnormal conformation of the protein and the receptor can’t correctly bind LDL . In this last case the disease is less severe. We can also have some other problems dealing with the recycling of the receptor. So the same disease can have different levels of severity. They are sometimes responsible for the complete non-expression of the gene, in this case the LDLR are completely absent on the cell's surface. In other cases, the protein is synthesized but it’s trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, causing an intracisternal retention. The final effect is the same as the non gene expression one because even in this case we won’t have LDLR on the surface. In these two cases the disease is severe. fig.4 Q: How does the problem in the synthesis lead to hypercholesterolemia? A: In hypercholesterolemia there is a mutation that leads to a lack of LDLR synthesis. If you don’t have LDLR, on the surface of hepatocytes there will be no LDLR. So LDL are produced, they are in the bloodstream but are not taken up by the liver. They remain in the liver leading to hypercholesterolemia. Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 41 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE DISORDERS In the case of autosomal recessive disorders, the recessive pathological gene determines the disease only in the homozygous state, meaning inheriting both pathologic genes, while the heterozygous state determines a healthy carrier. Figure 5 shows that if both the mother and the father are heterozygous for the pathologic gene, they don't manifest the disease, but they have a 25% probability to have a child that does manifest it in the homozygous form (aa), 50% that it will be a healthy carrier (Aa) and 25% that it will be a healthy subject (AA). These are some examples of autosomal recessive disorders (fig.6). fig.5 fig.6 NIEMANN-PICK TYLE C(NP-C)DISEASE It’s an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by mutations at the level of two main intracellular transporter proteins: NPC1, which encodes late endosome/lysosome transmembrane-bound protein NPC2, which encodes a soluble protein They both lead to the same process: the exit of cholesterol from the lysosomes. The functions of NCP1 and NCP2 are different but they are interconnected. Even if just one of these two proteins doesn’t work, the disease occurs. In the majority of cases NCP1 is mutated (95% of cases). Pathogenesis Niemann-pick disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the loss of function in either NPC1 or NPC2, which leads to the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal intracellular compartment (fig.7). So, cholesterol can’t be used for membrane formation. fig.7 Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 42 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 The main outcome arises at the level of the brain, leading to neurodegeneration (fig.8), but NCP1 and NPC2 are present also in other tissues and, as a consequence, cholesterol accumulates also in the lysosomes of the liver and spleen, causing, reduced life expectancy, hepatosplenomegaly, and lung deficiency, so it affects all the tissues, but mostly the liver, spleen and brain. Niemann pick is also known as child Alzheimer disease because it shares many features with Alzheimer's disease, but in children. In the transfer of cholesterol from LDL to fig.8 lysosomal membrane the lysosomes appear filled with cholesterol (fig.7). NPC2 is a soluble protein that flows inside the lysosome, it is able to bind cholesterol and acts as a shuttle to bring cholesterol to the lysosomal membrane where it finds NPC1. NPC1 is a transmembrane protein with several transmembrane domains on the surface of lysosomes, it binds cholesterol and it inserts it on the lysosomal membrane, allowing it to get out of the lysosome. The loss of function in either NPC1 or NPC2 leads to the same result: cholesterol is trapped in the lysosomes. The age of onset of NP-C is very early in life: 1. Newborn NP-C: liver disease at or soon after birth and causes early death, with erythroblastosis fetalis; 2. Early and late infantile NP-C (0-6 years) 3. Juvenile NP-C (6-15 years) 4. Adolescent/adult NP-C (>15 years) They are characterized mainly by neurological symptoms and visceral symptoms (in particular in children). Neuropathological features - Neuronal degeneration, due to cholesterol accumulation - child Alzheimer disease*, Alzheimer's-like neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta accumulation in the extracellular space. They are the two main histopathological features of this disease, at the level of the cerebral cortex. Neurofibrillary tangles are present intracellularly, in the cytoplasm of neurons. They are due to the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, a protein essential for neurons because it is responsible for microtubules stabilization. When tau is hyperphosphorylated, it detaches from microtubules, accumulates inside the neurons and they die. Another histopathological feature is the accumulation of amyloid beta accumulation in the extracellular space forming amyloid plaques, which are neurotoxic and cause neurons’ death. Neuroaxonal dystrophy - Demyelination - Neonatal jaundice - Hepatosplenomegaly -difficulty in speaking and in swallowing Clinical presentation • Cerebellar ataxia (movements disorder in 85-90% of NP-C patients) • Dystonia contributes to patient disability. it can either be focal (affecting hands, face, or upper limbs, or more generalized). Dystonia tends to occur later than other neurological signs during the course of NP-C. Psychiatric disorders • • Cognitive deficits, dementia (childhood Alzheimer’s) Niemann-Pick is a very rare disorder and there is not a cure for this disease, just like Alzheimer. Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 43 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 The only known information is that in these children there are some lesions that are similar to the ones present in Alzheimer’s disease and in other neurodegenerative disorders (eg. Lewy bodies typical of Parkison’s disease can be observed in NP too). This (fig.9) is an example of a little boy that was born without any symptoms, but was diagnosed with NP-C disease and probably had mutations at the level of NPC1. Since it is a progressive disease, symptoms started to arise at 3-4 years of age and they quickly got worse and worse. At 9 years old he was unable to swallow and wheelchair-bound. Unfortunately died at 10 years old. fig.9 When you have a reduced presence of NPC1 or NPC2, the quantity of cholesterol in lysosome is increased, while in the plasma membrane cholesterol is reduced. Some studies have demonstrated that cholesterol inside endosomes is responsible for the increased production of two proteins: • APP→ amino precursor protein, which will give rise to amyloid plaques) • BACE→ beta secretase, the main enzyme that cuts APP leading to the formation of amyloid plaques. Some ongoing studies are trying to understand the pathogenic mechanisms leading to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Q: What are amyloid plaques? A: They are accumulations of amyloid beta which is a neurotoxic protein produced starting from APP protein, which is a transmembrane protein present on the surface of neurons. This protein is cut by different proteases, it accumulates outside and it’s neurotoxic. It kills the neuron and inhibits the transmission of signals. CYSTIC FIBROSIS It is an autosomal recessive disorder, also called mucoviscidosis. It is characterized by different mutations at the level of the gene coding forCFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). CFTR is an epithelial chloride channel protein present on the surface of all exocrine glands, both mucus secreting glands and sweat glands. Age of onset Cystic fibrosis affects children, between birth and late childhood, and it’s very variable. It is usually said that the average life expectancy is 30 years, but there are many different grades of severity depending on the type of gene mutation so it’s difficult to predict the life expectancy. Some subjects have very severe cystic fibrosis, while in others this disease is compatible with life. Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 44 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 CFTR structure This is a physiological CFTR (fig.10). After gene expression, the protein goes through the ER, Golgi apparatus and finally reaches the surface where it has two transmembrane domains. CFTR is present on the surface of all exocrine glands, both in mucous and in sweat glands, but in these two types of glands, it in the opposite way. fig.10 Pathogenesis In mucous secreting glands, CFTRregulates the passage of chloride from the inside to the outside of cells. In parallel, CFTR regulates two other membrane proteins: • ENaC (epithelial Na+ channel). It is a sodium channel that brings sodium inside the cell. CFTR regulates ENaC by inhibiting it and sodium remains out of the cell. So outside there will be sodium chloride salts, which bring water out of the cell. By doing so the mucus becomes normally hydrated. ORCC (outwardly rectified chloride channel). It is another chloride channel activated by CFTR and it has the same function as CFTR: to bring chloride out. When CFTR is not present or is not working properly, as in the right side of fig.11, chloride can’t go out anymore and it remains inside the cells. Moreover, CFTR is not able to inactive ENaC channels so too much sodium goes inside the cells, followed by water. Since water goes inside the cells, the mucous becomes very dehydrated. Normally, as shown on the right of fig.11, CFTR is present and working, so chloride goes out and just a small amount of sodium gets in (very thin arrow) because CFTR inhibits ENaC channels. Similarly, just a small amount of water gets in. So outside we have sodium and water and the mucous will be normal, hydrated. fig.11 In sweat secreting glands CFTR works in the opposite way (fig.12): chloride is taken up by CFTR. In cystic fibrosis, since CFTR is not present or not properly working, chloride remains outside of the cell. This doesn’t lead to problems at the level of the sweat gland itself, but the only important consequence is that the sweat is very salty. This is important because it’s a way to recognize if a newborn might be affected by cystic fibrosis. fig.12 Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 45 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 very severe. In some other cases CFTR is only produced in less amounts so on the surface you find CFTR but it’s not enough to exert its function. This is a less severe form of cystic fibrosis. There could also be a normal amount of CFTR present on the membrane but it is not able to bind ATP correctly and does not work. fig.13 Mutations There are different mutations responsible for cystic fibrosis (fig.13). The mutations might lead to the complete absence of CFTR on the cell’s membrane or there could be an intracisternal retention in the ER or Golgi. In these two cases the disease is The main gene mutation (fig. 14) that leads to cystic fibrosis is the deletion of a codon in position 508: delta phenylalanine 508. This deletion is responsible for the intracisternal retention of CFTR. It’s a very severe form, so if phenylalanine is lacking, CFTR will still be produced but it will be trapped in the Golgi apparatus and there will be no CFTR on the surface. fig.14 In these pictures (fig.15) it is possible to find: • normal CFTR in which chloride goes out of the cell • absent CFTR in which chloride, sodium and water remain inside the cell • non normal CFTR that allows the passage of just a small amount of chloride, water and sodium. The mucous will be only partially hydrated. fig.15 Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 46 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 CYSTIC FIBROSIS IN THE DIFFERENT AFFECTED ORGANS OF EXOCRINE Pancreas fig.16 The term “cystic fibrosis” comes from cystic/fibrosis formation that occur at the level of the pancreas. 90% of patients have pancreatic abnormalities (chronic pancreatitis) because the mucous is so thick in the exocrine pancreas that it occludes the pancreatic ducts bringing to atrophy of the exocrine glands and cell necrosis. Eventually necrosis induces inflammation (acute pancreatitis, that then becomes chronic pancreatitis) and then there is an attempt to repair the damage thanks to the activation of fibroblasts that secrete extracellular matrix. As a consequence, fibrosis increases at the level of the pancreas giving rise to cystic fibrosis (fig.16). If the exocrine part of the pancreas doesn't work, pancreatic juices are not produced and this leads to steatorrhea (abundant and smelling excrements due to no fat absorption), growth retardation, nutritional deficiency (lack of fat-soluble vitamins: avitaminosis A, D, K) and squamous metaplasia of the lining epithelium of the ducts in the pancreas. This process only affects the exocrine portion. Respiratory tract At the level of the respiratory tract the mucus is particularly thick and dehydrated (fig.17), the consequence is that there is a tendency to develop infections that can lead to pneumonia. Recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia are the main causes of cell death. Pulmonary changes are observed in all cases of cystic fibrosis and they are the most serious complication of the disease. There is marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucosal glands. The insufficient hydration of the mucus and the consequent alteration of the activity of the celia, determines the inability to effectively remove the bacteria (eg. pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen). Gastrointestinal tract fig.17 The typical symptom is meconium ileus(in italiano “ileo da meconio”): an obstruction of the small intestine in newborns. This is a way to identify a child that is affected by cystic fibrosis, together with salty sweat. Meconium derives from the ingestion of liquids coming from the mother during pregnancies. If two or three days after birth the baby is not able to evacuate, meconium is not released, exams have to be carried out immediately in order to understand if the baby is affected with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, mothers and doctors have to pay attention to this in the immediate postpartum. Liver Bile canaliculi are plugged by mucus material. Hepatic steatosis is not an uncommon finding in liver biopsies. If this situation lasts for a long time, cirrhosis can develop. This liver involvement is found only in 5% of patients with CF. Reproductive system At the level of the reproductive system, males have some peculiarities: congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens or obstruction of the vas deferens by dense secretions that lead to infertility. Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 47 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 There’s also the lack of some fat-soluble vitamins, due to steatorrhea, that lead to anovulatory cycles in women, which can be a cause of infertility. Thick and adherent cervical mucus plug is also present. Salivary glands The salivary glands frequently show histologic changes similar to those described in the pancreas: progressive dilation of ducts, squamous metaplasia of the lining epithelium, and glandular atrophy followed by fibrosis. Treatment There isn’t a definite treatment able to cure cystic fibrosis. The main forms of treatment are: - Infection control: removal of pulmonary secretions and antibiotic therapy - Prevention of spreading of infection by wearing masks - Administration of pancreatic enzyme substitutes (before eating, patients need to get pancreatic enzymes because the exocrine pancreas doesn’t work) - Lung and liver-pancreas transplantation Gene therapy CFTR has been cloned. The transfer of the non-mutated gene encoding CFTR into cells of patients cultured in vitro is able to correct the transport defect of chlorine and restore its normal functionality. The professor mentions a couple of articles on gene therapy that she found on pubmed. These are the links: • • INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM There are many recessive disorders that are due to the lack of key enzymes in metabolic pathways (fig.18). Now phenylketonuria and alkaptonuria will be discussed, theseare two disorders related to the metabolism of phenylalanine. PHENYLKETONURIA fig.18 It is an autosomal recessive disorder in which there is a deficiency ofphenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), an enzyme that transforms phenylalanine into tyrosine. If the enzyme is lacking, tyrosine is not created, and phenylalanine accumulates in blood. This is why phenylketonuria is also called hyperphenylalaninemia. This disorder brings to CNS development alterations after birth because tyrosine is necessary for the biosynthesis of catecholamines, so neurotransmitters that are necessary for brain development, a condition called phenylpyruvic oligophrenia. Moreover, affected children have very blonde hair and blue eyes because tyrosine is a key molecule responsible for melanin production. These physical features are similar to those of albinism, in which the enzyme that transforms tyrosine into melanin is lacking. In phenylketonuria this enzyme is present but since less tyrosine sick people don’t produce much melanin. Since this is an autosomal recessive disorder, the affected child has to be homozygous, and the mother will for sure be heterozygous. During pregnancy the baby is able to use the PAH of the mother, while after birth he can’t do that anymore To sum up, in newborns there are: cerebral damage and mental retardation: phenylpyruvic oligophrenia• • light-colored skin, eyes and hair The treatment consists in the elimination of phenylalanine from the diet, as it is present in all products from animal origin. Therefore, patients need to take semi-synthetic formulations that have no phenylalanine and are rich in tyrosine. Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 48 17.03.2023 GAMBA L.4 Maternal phenylketonuria→ elevated maternal phenylalanine levels during pregnancy are teratogenic, so phenylalanine and its metabolites cross the placenta and affect specific foetal organs during development. In order to avoid disorders in the embryo, maternal dietary restriction of phenylalanine has to be initiated before conception and continued throughout pregnancy. Moreover, if the foetus is homozygous for the mutation, the mother is administered with tyrosine. Malignant hyperphenylalaninemia→ these are some severe cases in which the dietary intake of tyrosine and the elimination of phenylalanine is not sufficient. In this case there is also a malfunction and deficit of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Patients with malignant hyperphenylalaninemia cannot be treated by dietary restriction of phenylalanine. ALKAPTONURIA It is the first metabolic disorder to have been discovered. Alkaptonuria is a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for homogentisic acid oxidase, an enzyme belonging to phenylalanine metabolism which normally degrades homogentisic acid into water and carbon dioxide. As a consequence, in alkaptonuria there is an accumulation of homogentisic acid (alkapton). Alkaptonuria leads to (fig.19): - Dark urine due to presence of akapton inside - Generalized pigmentation of nails, ears, skin, sclera and blue cartilage tending to black - Arthritis It doesn’t reduce patients’ life expectancy. fig.19 Fiamma Cusumano, Samuele Scagliola 49", "input": "", "output": "Genetic diseases\n\n**what is the difference between genetic and congenital disorders? Genetic disorders are disorders that derive from changes in the DNA (mutations), that most of the time derived from one parent and are transmitted to the germline, so they are familial.**\nCongenital disorder means a disorder that appears after birth, you are born with it. A congenital disorder can also be due to genetic mutations, if it manifests right after birth (20% of them). Only 4% are due to chromosome abnormalities (because they are generally not compatible with birth). But they can be the effect of pathogenic factors present in the fetal environment (so something that is not genetic but derives from the environment). Factors can be of chemical, physical or biological nature. In these cases we will have embriopathies or fetopathies. 70% of congenital disorders are of unknown origin. There are also conditions in which genetic and environmental factors coexist in generating the disorder.\n\n**what is teratology and its principles?**\nTeratology is the study of developmental anomalies. Teratogens are chemical, physical and biological agents that cause these anomalies (toxins, drugs, etc) Main principles: Teratogens induce death, growth retardation, malformation, and functional impairment. The mechanism is specific for each teratogen. The teratogenesis is dose dependent. The more the teratogen, the more danger. Susceptibility to teratogens is variable: depending on the genotypes of the fetus and of the mother e.g: not all fetuses from alcoholic mothers develop fetal alcohol syndrome. Susceptibility for the teratogens is specific for each embryological stage. different stages of fetal development are more sensitive to some teratogens than others, according to what part of the body is developing and how that teratogen interacts in the body. The first trimester of pregnancy is a very susceptible one in general because the most important tissues and organs are forming.\n\n**what drug was prescribed for anxiety for pregnant women in 1960 that turned out to be a teratogen?**\nThalidomide. It caused phocomelia: malformations in the arms (seal fins). Still used in chemotherapy today as it induces apoptosis of cancer cells\n\n**Describe fetal alcohol syndrome**\nsyndrome caused by chronic maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol consumption during the first trimester is particularly dangerous. Affected children present: mental retardation (most common case of acquired mental retardation) clumsy movements, impulsive behavior underweight Deformities: microcephaly malformations of the heart, of the limbs and joints Facial (make the syndrome phenotypically recognised): small and widely spaced eyes thin upper lip small nose, upward receding chin corneal damage drooping eyelids midline of the upper lip (philtrum) poorly developed If only some of these alterations are present you don’t say that you are in front of a fetal alcohol syndrome, but only of the fetal alcohol effect.\n\n**Describe torch complex**\nTorch is an acronym that stands for Toxoplasma Others (syphilis, tuberculosis, Varicella-Zoster virus, Parvovirus B19, Hepatitis, HIV), Rubella Cytomegalovirus Herpes simplex virus. These are the main causes of this syndrome, (not all together!!) They are the main causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. During pregnancy a toxoplasma test is done and if the mother is negative for toxoplasma she can’t eat ‘prosciutto crudo’ (raw ham) or ‘not washed vegetables’. The spectrum of symptoms is common for all the different biological causes: lethargy, fever, feeding difficulties, anemia, petechiae... But the most frequent are growth retardation and brain, eye, liver and heart abnormalities. The severe damage inflicted is largely irreparable.\n\n**What is Huntington disease (HD)?**\nHD (5-10:100.000) is an autosomal dominant disease. There is no sporadic form. It is caused by degeneration of striatal neurons and\n\n**characterized by a progressive movement disorder and dementia.**\nJerky, hyperkinetic, sometimes dystonic movements (chorea) are characteristic, affected individuals may later develop bradykinesia and rigidity. It is relentlessly progressive and uniformly fatal, with an average course of 15 years after its onset is at around 30-45 years of age.\n\n**Explain the pathogenesis of Huntington disease**\nHD is caused by a polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the HTT gene, on chromosome 4, that encodes the huntingtin protein and causes a toxic-gain of function on huntingtin. Although it is expressed in all tissues of the body the mutation affects only parts of the CNS: the cortex and basal ganglia. Norma: 5-30 CAG repeats Pre-mutation: 30-35 repeats Mutation: 36-120 times (>36 glutamine residues = polyglutamine tract)\n\n**The higher the amount of repeats, the earlier the age of onset of the disease.**\nPathogenesis is still under investigation: HTT is neuroprotective, pro-development. Mutated HTT (mHTT): Disrupts proteosomal and autophagic pathways resulting in accumulation of toxic debris, including toxic huntingtin → necrosis toxic huntingtin accumulation in the nucleus can negatively regulate the normal transcription of genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, synaptic function, axonal transport, protection against oxidative stress\n\n**Describe fragile X syndrome (Martin-Bell syndrome) X-linked genetic disorder.**\nFreq. 1:1550 (affected males); 1:1800 (affected females) Females having two X chromosomes have less symptoms, so men are primarily affected by this condition (as in all X-linked conditions) It is the second most common genetic cause of mental retardation after Down syndrome. DYNAMIC MUTATION, ie subsequent generations have greater genetic damage. The locus involved in fragile X syndrome is called FRAXA (it’s a fragile site in the chromosome) and it’s found on the long arm of chromosome X(Xq27.3) which is the location of the gene FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1). This gene encodes for FMRP a RNA-binding protein that controls dendritic spines functionality. In affected individuals, dendritic spines have been found to be longer, thinner and immature and have been appointed as the main cause for mental retardation. Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion of an unstable triplet: CGG, that silences the gene and subsequently prevents the transcription of the protein. The severity of the mental retardation depends on the degree of expansion of the triplet: Normal: 6 to 46 repeats healthy carrier: 50-200 repeats Disease: >230 (up to 4000) repeats\n\n**CHARACTERISTIC PHYSICAL PHENOTYPE**\nHigh forehead Long face with a large mandible Long / large nose Thin / retracted lips Large everted ears High arched palate Total or partial macrodontia MACRO-ORCHIDISM (large testicles) LOCALIZED MUSCULAR HYPOTHONY HYPEREXTENSIBLE JOINTS MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE BEHAVIORAL FEATURES: Stereotyped movements Atypical social development (Shyness, Autism)\n\n**Describe Achondroplasia**\nAchondroplasia = Dysmorphic dwarfism (”nanismo disarmonico”). Short limbs and large head. Autosomal dominant (manifests in heterozygous). Complete penetrance (genotype always leads to a particular phenotype bc it is always expressed). Mutation on gene FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) on ch.4 that encodes for an RTK that when mutated auto-phosphorylates itself even in the absence of a ligand which results in the slowing down of chondrocyte proliferation in the epiphysis of long bones.\n\n**Describe Osteogenesis imperfecta**\nAn encompassing term for many diseases affecting connective tissue due to a lack of a certain type of collagen. More than 90% of cases are due to mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, that are involved in the production of type I collagen. Causing fragile bones, fractures, hearing loss and blue sclerae.\n\n**Describe Marfan syndrome**\nautosomal dominant condition (1:5.000) 70-85% of cases are familial. 1/3 of the cases is caused by sporadic mutations. Connective tissue disorder caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which encodes for fibrilin type I (an ECM glycoprotein necessary for the formation of connective tissue). NORMAL: Fibrilin-1 aggregates into functional microfibrils and sequesters TGF-β in the ECM, regulating its signaling.

It is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by progressive neuronal death, hepato-splenomegaly, lung deficiency and reduced life expectancy. Age of onset is very variable and it goes from 0 to over 15 years old. Mutations: NPC1 (chromosome 18q 11-12) encoding late endosome/lysosomal transmembrane-bound protein (95% of cases). NPC2 (chromosome 14q 24.3) encoding a lysosomal soluble protein (5% of cases)\n\n**NPC1 and NPC2 proteins unload cholesterol from lysosomes into the**\ncytoplasm.

They need LDL plasmapheresis\n\n**Describe Cystic fibrosis**\nCystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in\n\n**Europe which is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator) on chromosome 7, which is a chloride channel expressed by epithelial cells. It has an incidence of 1 in 2.500 births. 2-4% of the population are healthy carriers. It affects children (between birth and late childhood). Very variable. average life expectancy is 30 years.**\nOver 1000 different mutations, class 1-3 are severe (less than 10% of residual CFTR activity) Class 1: No CFTR protein synthesis. Mutations that cause this are nonsense or frameshift. 2nd most common mutation → Gly542X Class 2: CFTR trafficking defect (from ER to Golgi) caused by missense or deletions. Including the most prevalent (82%) of mutations: Phe508del, caused by deletion of three base pairs leading to the loss of phenylalanine → retention of misfolded protein in ER. Class 3: Defective channel regulation (impaired opening of channel) missense Class 4: reduced conduction (decreased flow of ions) missense. Class 5: reduced synthesis. Missense. Class 6: decreased stability on pm. Missense.\n\n**When CTFR protein is malfunctioning or missing, it loses its ability to transport chloride and bicarbonate ions. CFTR also regulates other ion channels such as:**outwardly-rectifying chloride channels, inwardly rectifying potassium channels, and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY Malfunctioning or missing Chloride channels and Loss of normal ENaC inhibition: in normal conditions ENaC is responsible for sodium uptake from the lumen, and it is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR. Thus, when CFTR is mutated, there’s 1. decreased Cl- secretion into the lumen: Chloride ions are negatively charged, and their movement is accompanied by the movement of water. When chloride ions exit the cell through the CFTR channel, water follows, helping maintain the proper balance of fluids on the surface of the cell lining 2. loss of inhibition of ENaC leading to an abnormal amount of sodium absorption from the lumen, followed by water. The surface layer coating mucosal cells becomes dehydrated and dense, leading to defective muco-cilliary action and accumulation of hyper-concentrated viscous secretions that obstruct the air passages and predispose to recurrent pulmonary infections.\n\n**CLINICAL FINDINGS**\nThe most abundant (all cases of CF) and severe complication is at the level of the lungs: Marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucosal glands. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is the most common pathogen. Recurrent bronchitis and bronchopneumonia. 85-90% of CF patients have chronic pancreatitis: CFTR is also permeable to bicarbonate ions. There are CFTR mutations where chloride transport is mostly preserved but bicarbonate transport is abnormal. Normal tissue secretes alkaline fluids into the lumen. When bicarbonate cannot be transported from the cell to the lumen, there’s a decrease in luminal pH (it becomes more acidic), and that can lead to precipitation of mucin that clogs ducts and increases binding of bacteria to these mucins. This mechanism on top of what previously described leads to pancreatic insufficiency. ****The total loss of exocrine secretion alters fat absorption→ steatorrhea, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, squamous metaplasia of the lining epithelium of the ducts in the pancreas REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM: Infertility in 95% of the males who survive to adulthood): congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or obstruction of the vas deferens by dense secretions; females with anovulatory cycles Salty sweat, typical of the disease happens because in sweat glands, ENaC activity decreases with loss of CFTR, contrary to the other parts of the body, so it increases sodium chloride concentration in sweat. GI tract complications: viscous plugs of mucus in the small intestine of infants may cause small-bowel obstruction or meconium ileus → obstruction of the small intestine in the newborn due to the inability to evacuate the meconium (newborn's first poop) ****in the immediate postpartum period (5-10% of infants with CF). LIVER: Bile canaliculi are plugged by mucus material. Hepatic steatosis → cirrhosis may develop in 5% of patients. SALIVARY GLANDS: progressive dilation of ducts, squamous metaplasia of the lining epithelium, and glandular atrophy followed by fibrosis.\n\n**TREATMENT**\nThe mean age of survival of Cystic Fibrosis has risen. CF treatment is still largely focused on targeting the symptoms. Infection control: removal of pulmonary secretions and antibiotic therapy. Administration of pancreatic enzyme substitutes Lung and liver-pancreas transplantation Emerging Gene therapy: transfer of the non-mutated gene encoding CFTR into cells of patients cultured in vitro is able to correct the transport defect of chlorine and restore its normal functionality.\n\n**Describe Phenylketonuria**\nAutosomal recessive disorder. PKU= hyperphenylalaninemia 1:10.000 , more prevalent in white and asian pp. 1:5000 Deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) → inability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine. In newborns it causes cerebral damage and metal retardation (phenyl pyruvic oligophrenia) Inability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine reduces conversion of tyrosine into melanin leads to light colored skin, hair and eyes. Treatment: elimination of phenylalanine from diet + tyrosine intake.\n\n**Special types**\nMaternal phenylketonuria (mother has classic PKU): Elevated maternal phenylalanine levels during pregnancy are teratogenic, its effects include mental retardation, microcephaly, congenital heart disease, and birth defects. Malignant hyperphenylalaninemia →severe form of hyperphenylalaninemia where there is also deficit of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) a cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Here dietary intake of tyrosine and the elimination of phenylalanine is not sufficient.\n\n****\n\n**Describe Alkaptonuria**\nIt is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the gene that codes for the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. HGD enzyme cannot metabolize the homogentisic acid (generated from tyrosine) into 4-maleylacetoacetate, and homogentisic acid levels and its oxidized form (alkapton) in the blood are 100-fold higher than would normally be expected, despite the fact that a substantial amount is eliminated into the urine by the kidneys (giving it an unusually dark color). The accumulating homogentisic acid causes generalized pigmentation (homogentisic acid is converted to benzoquinone acetic acid which forms polymers that resemble the skin pigment melanin) pigmented polymers also accumulate in cartilage causing damage (leading to arthritis) damage to heart valves, precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. normal life expectancy\n\n**Symptoms usually develop in people over 30 years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.**"}

These thrombi consist of blood cells (different types, mainly platelets) and fibrin (important for the stabilization of the blood clot). As just said, these blood clots generally have the same composition of normal blood clots; however, in this case, they adhere to the vessel wall following an abnormal hemostatic process. For this reason, these blood clots (even if their composition is normal) are named “thrombi”, since they imply a pathological process without an injury of the vessel wall (bleeding); on the contrary to normal blood clots that have the aim to block the bleeding. This process is due to an inappropriate and pathological activation of the hemostatic processes occurring inside the vessels. This abnormality may be caused by:\n\n**increased activity of coagulation factors:**hypercoagulability;\n\n**reduction of hemostasis control:**reduction of the cascade inhibitors;\n\n**reduced fibrinolytic activity;**\n\n**reduction of all the inhibitors that control the coagulation cascade.**\nThrombosis can affect any point of the cardiovascular system. In fact the thrombi can develop in the cardiac cavities, especially at the sites of the valvular cusps, but also inside the arteries, veins and capillaries. So, any district of our cardiovascular system can be affected. VIRCHOW TRIAD IN THROMBOSIS In 1856, the scientist Virchow suggested possible causes of thrombosis proposing the so-called “triad in thrombosis” (fig.1). This theory includes the three main important conditions that can lead to the development of thrombosis: 1.Endothelial injury: a dysfunction in the endothelium. It is mainly caused by hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis or in general any inflammation at the level of the vessel wall. Indeed, as said in the previous lecture, Fig.1 a well functioning endothelium has anti-thrombogenic properties inhibiting aggregation and adhesion of the platelets. This is possible through the secretion of some factors as: NO and prostaglandin E2 that inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation, and other factors that can stimulate fibrinolytic activity as tissue plasminogen activators that will lead to the formation of plasminogen (main player in clot formation). In case of a damage, the endothelium is not able to contrast the platelets aggregation, losing its anti-aggregative properties. So, if the fibrinolytic system is not functioning, there will be problems in dissolving the abnormal blood clot. In this situation we can have formation of thrombi, especially in the heart and arteries. Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 43 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 The major causes for endothelial injury are: a. Infectious causes (bacteria, virus, parasites), b. Mechanical causes (trauma, iatrogenic maneuvers), c. Toxic and chemical causes (drugs, radiation, hyperlipidemia; most frequently hypercholesterolemia in atherosclerosis, bile pigments, homocystinuria, cyanide and carbon monoxide anoxia, cigarette smoke, etc. - Note: all these factors are present also in atherosclerosis: indeed, the risk of thrombosis is directly associated with atherosclerosis. In fact, in advanced plaques, the rupture of a plaque is very easy to happen, resulting in the formation of a thrombus on the top of the plaque itself) d. Immunological causes (immunocomplex or anti-endothelial antibodies cytotoxic lymphocytes). 2.Abnormal blood flow: especially in stasis conditions, in which blood flow is reduced, or in case of turbulence (so in changes in force, quantity and direction of the blood flow). a. One of the most common causes of thrombosis is the reduction of the blood flow: a condition of stasis (common especially in hospitalized patients in bed for long or that are immobilized for a long time). b. Another condition contributing to abnormal flow is blood stasis, when there is a marked reduction in the blood flow due to an irregularity in the vessel wall or an abrupt change in flow direction. This cas be seen in vascular bifurcations, arterial arches or when there is a narrowing of vessels. c. Another point that can favor the formation of thrombi is the formation of vortices and turbulence. This is typical in case of aneurysms, narrowing, ectasia (dilation)... In fact, these conditions alter the speed and regularity of the laminar blood flow resulting in: i. the promotion of platelet adhesion to the endothelium, ii. in reduced dilution of procoagulant factors, iii. in delayed flow of inhibitors of factors iv. in endothelial cell activation. Difference in probability of thrombosis in arteries and veins: We know that arterial blood flow is faster; hence, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation are limited. However, all these situations in which there is turbulence and/or a reduction in blood flow speed (like in aneurysms) can contribute to arterial and cardiac thrombi formation. Note: in case of arterial thrombi, usually you have only partial occlusion of the vessel, not a total one; this is due to the faster blood flow. Venous flow is slower. So, the thrombus is more easily formed and grows more quickly, especially when there is a stasis of blood flow. Therefore, it is more common to have clots occluding totally the vessels. This condition is typical of veins of the lower extremities that, because of the numerous valves, allow venous thrombi to begin in their pockets. 3. The third point regards the hypercoagulability, meaning an increased coagulation that depends on:\n\n**abnormal trigger of the coagulation cascade,**\n\n**increased production and secretion of factors that favor coagulation cascade**\n\n**reduction or lack of one or more anticoagulative factors:**factors negatively controlling the coagulation process.\n\n**alteration of the fibrinolytic system. This means that there is a predisposition to activate the coagulation cascade**\nNikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 44 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 CAUSES OF HYPERCOAGULABILITY Hypercoagulability has many different causes: Primitive forms (genetic): mutations of the factor V deficiency of antithrombin III that control the excessive coagulation defects of fibrinolysis Secondary forms (acquired or associated to specific pathological conditions): prolonged bed rest or immobilization: these patients are more prone to develop thrombosis, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, tissue injury (fracture, burn, surgery that imply an immobilization in bed for a long time). cancers, prosthetic cardiac valves: the thrombi can form more easily at the level of these artificial valves DIFFERENT TYPES OF THROMBI: The type of thrombus that will be formed depends on: 1.SPEED of the BLOOD FLOW 2.RAPIDITY of the COAGULATIVE PROCESS CASCADE. From an anatomical point of view, in a thrombus we can observe:\n\n**head:**attachment point to the endothelium wall,\n\n**body:**variable size, composition, and mobility,\n\n**tail:**this is the part of the thrombus not attached to the vessel, often long. This is the portion that more easily detaches in the veins. This fragment, when detached, can travel in the circulation system, giving rise to the embolus. Hence, the difference between thrombus and embolus is:\n- A thrombus is attached to the wall - the embolus travels into the circulation CLASSIFICATION BASED OF MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS: There are different types of thrombi, which can be classified based on morphological characteristics.\n\n**White thrombi:**they have a grayish-white appearance and are the most friable and fragile, so they can be fragmented more easily causing an embolism. They are white in color because they consist mainly of platelets and fibrin. If there is inflammation, the white thrombus may contain leukocytes and erythocytes as well.\nIn arteries, the rapid blood flow makes it difficult for white thrombi to grow, resulting in normally small thrombi that do not occlude completely lumen of the vessels. In case of a Slow-down current in veins (reduction of blood flow), these white thrombi can enlarge, become totally obstructive and contain increasing amounts of erythrocytes that are progressively entrapped in the thrombi and that substitute some of the platelets.\n\n**Red thrombi:**tenacious, elastic, firm, attached to the vessel wall with only a very small portion of the head (white thrombi are attached with the whole head). They are red in color because they consist of a few platelets, fibrin and a prevalence of red blood cells and some leukocytes.\nNikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 45 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 Typically formed in the venous district where the blood flow slows down (stasis), contributing to the quick growth of the thrombi, resulting in a very high risk of occlusion of veins. So, as venous flow is slower, these thrombi can become obstructive. They are typically found in the lower extremities due to immobilization. darker erythrocytes-rich layers. Mainly present in heart and less frequently in the legs.\n\n**Mixed or variegated thrombi (fig.2):**thrombi with grossly and microscopically apparent white laminations called lines of Zahn, which are pale platelet and fibrin deposits alternated with\nIn the white lines - lines of Zahn: prevalence of platelets - In the red lines: prevalence of erythrocytes Fig.2 CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO THE EFFECTS ON THE VESSEL CANALIZATION:\n\n**Parietal or mural thrombi:**adherent to the wall, usually white, more frequent in arteries, especially in the the aortic lumen, and in heart chambers. Generally, they are not completely obstructive, just partially.\nAortic thrombi: mural or parietal, usually develop at the site of an aneurysm or on the top of an ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque (ruptured). Remember that one of the most severe risks of an advanced plaque is the rupture where, at the site of ulceration, there is the immediate activation of the platelet aggregation and activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in the formation of a thrombus that can compromise the already partially occluded artery. Cardiac mural thrombi: develop in the heart endomyocardial injury. ■In fig.3 are represented thrombi in the left chambers due to abnormal myocardial contraction. For example, in case of arrhythmias, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction or and right ventricular apices (arrows), Fig.3 overlying white fibrous scar.\n\n**Obstructive thrombi:**they occupy all the vessel’s lumen determining the obstruction and the block of the circulation. They can lead not only to ischemia but also to an infarction in case of a total obstruction (ischemic necrosis).Usually they are mixed or mostly red thrombi because the red thrombi can develop in the venous system where the blood flow is slower in comparison to that of arterial blood flow, resulting in easier growth.\nCLASSIFICATION BASED ON THE VESSEL-FORMATION DISTRICT - LOCATION:\n\n**Cardiac thrombosis:**\nmural (or parietal) thrombi that don't occlude totally. They are formed in the cardiac cavities, quite often at the level of valve leaflets. Thrombi that develop at the sides of the heart valves are specifically called vegetations. They are generally favored by : arrhythmias, Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 46 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 atrial dilatations or fibrillation by bloodborne bacteria or fungi. These microorganisms can adhere and direcly damage the valves (e.g. rheumatic heart disease) leading also to endocarditis. They are usually white or mixed (very fragile). Hence, they easily embolize and can go to: - the lungs if they are in the right part of the heart → pulmonary embolism - or to other areas such as the brain, kidneys and so on if they are in the left part.\n\n**Arterial thrombosis:**\nwhite thrombi present in the arteries and consisting mainly of platelets and fibrin. They are mural or parietal and usually not occlusive but, in conditions in which blood flow is slower, the thrombi can grow in size and become occlusive. They grow in a retrograde fashion (against blood flow) with respect to the point of attachment, meaning that they propagate towards the heart, and because of the blood flow that is opposite to their growth, it's more difficult for them to become bigger. Causes: usually superimposed on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque or other inflammatory vascular injury such as vasculitis, traumas or where there is a marked turbulence; at the level of aneurysms (aortic aneurysm) or in turbulent areas, like vessel bifurcation; stasis in the infarcted area due to non-contractile myocardium, stasis due to dilation of the left atrium following atrial fibrillation or cardiac rheumatism which causes stenosis of the mitral valve, ischemic necrosis or cerebral infarction/stroke. Most common sites include major arteries like the coronary arteries, cerebral and femoral arteries, but also aorta. High risk of embolization, like in cardiac thrombosis, which may target the brain, kidneys and spleen, as these thrombi are more fragile.\n\n**Venous thrombosis:**\nCharacterized by red thrombi that consist mainly of red blood cells and only a few platelets and fibrin. They develop usually due to stasis (reduction in blood flow compared to arteries) where they can grow and easily become occlusive. In the veins, we can sometimes also find mixed thrombi. They can reach large dimensions and a morphological complexity. They grow in the direction of blood flow, meaning that they propagate towards the heart. We can distinguish two types of venous thrombosis, depending on the fact if they are associated with an inflammatory state or not: ■Thrombophlebitis: condition in which these venous thrombi are implanted on endothelial lesions of inflammatory nature that cause the endothelial dysfunction. The symptomatology is similar to that of an inflammatory response: pain especially of legs, including redness, edema, pain, etc. ■Phlebothrombosis: condition in which the venous thrombi are implanted on endothelial lesions in the absence of inflammation. As a result, this non-inflammatory condition presents no symptoms or a very limited edema because of obstaculation of blood flow. It is also typical of legs. 90% of venous thrombosis affects the legs. In particular, we can also distinguish among deep and superficial thrombi: ■Superficial venous thrombosis: affects the saphenous vein with the formation of varicose veins (varicosities) causing local pain, congestion, swelling and tenderness that then Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 47 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 degenerate towards varicose ulcers with rupture of the varices and sometimes rare embolization (they are the least severe type of thrombi). ■Deep venous thrombosis: most severe, affects the popliteal, femoral, iliac veins. It is asymptomatic in 50% of cases, but local pain and edema can be present in the remaining cases. This condition is more serious because these thrombi can easily embolize, resulting in pulmonary embolism. In fact, we can also talk about pulmonary thromboembolism because it is caused by fragments of venous thrombi that have ruptured/detached from the main thrombus in the legs and traveled via the circulation to the lungs. Venous thrombosis is one of the most frequent thrombosis because it is associated with all the cases of hypercoagulation and of stasis such as: - surgery, - traumas and burns - cancer, - long immobilization, advanced age and reduced physical activity - after childbirth - oral contraceptive (which can induce hypercoagulation of blood) A particularly serious form of venous thrombosis is the one occurring at the level of the sine of dura madre. This is an life-threatening condition, as it is often connected to septic processes and infections of mastoid, auricular or sinus cavities (sinusitis) that activate hypercoagulation. The result is a neurological problem. THROMBUS EVOLUTION A thrombus can totally or partially occlude the blood flow of a vessel (more often totally in veins), causing: - ischemia if it is partial - or ischemic necrosis or infarction when total. After being formed, the thrombus can also be digested by the fibrinolytic system and monocytes and macrophages, resulting in its resolution/digestion. However, in this case the thrombus becomes more fragile and can easily be fragmented. The risk is that these fragments can travel in the circulatory system causing embolism where they meet a narrow vessel and block it. Another evolution is the reorganization of the thrombus, in which new vessels develop within the thrombus. Therefore, we have vascularization, causing the thrombus to grow faster and quickly. As a result, this now bulkier thrombus, which previously only partially occluded the lumen of the vessel, can now completely Fig.4 occlude the vessel causing infarction. Another possibility is that there is a recanalization within the thrombus, meaning that there is a continuity of the circulation (with new vessels formed) through the thrombus thanks to the interaction between the thrombus vessels and other vessels nearby it. In this way, as this process develops, there will be an integration of the thrombus in the vessel wall after a 'reorganization' of the thrombus, and a resulting thickening of the wall in the point where the thrombus was. Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 48 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 Reported below is the mechanism of thrombus evolution taken from the slides: 1)After 1 day from aggregation there is the autolysis of platelets and their replacement by erythrocytes and fibrin (initially all the thrombi are white and subsequently become red or variegated) 2)Thrombus is then invaded by monocytes/macrophages. The macrophage activity and fibrinolysis cause lysis or dissolution or softening of the thrombus, which all result in the resolution or dissolution: reduce the blood flow obstruction. 3)This process is a risk factor for embolization: where part of thrombus dislodges and travels to other sites in the vasculature. The total digestion of the thrombus and repair of the vessel (recent thrombi) can be achieved. 4)ECs, SMCs, and fibroblast can invade the thrombus forming solid cords and then capillary channels can organize to favor the growth of the thrombus and lead to occlusion. 5)Subsequently, possible recanalization of the vessel: event that restores the continuity of the blood flow, takes place. In the end the thrombus is a vascularized mass of connective/fibrous tissue embedded in the wall (intimate thickening or scar repair) (older thrombus) 6)Further evolution of the thrombus may consist in the precipitation of calcium salts resulting in calcification. CLINICAL FEATURES OF THROMBOSIS The presence of a thrombus in the vessels’ lumen is a highly dangerous condition characterized by symptoms that are mainly due to the alteration of the blood circulation following the obstruction or occlusion (partial or total) of arteries or veins, or the rise of emboli. Therefore, thrombosis complications present different degrees of severity: 1.In the absence of collateral circulation, the totalocclusion evolves in serious damage and eventually an infarction characterized by ischemic necrosis. (Sometimes, also in the case of a complete occlusion, some collateral vessels may be formed perfusing the obstructed area. Hence, This way, we won’t have an infarction but only ischemia). 2.Partial occlusion or possibility of collateral circulation results in more or less serious damage leading to hypoxia, swelling, hypotrophy or atrophy, fibrosis over time. 3.Complete or partial detachment of the thrombus causes embolism, a very high-risk condition. As previously stated, we can distinguish three different types of thrombosis:\n\n**cardiac thrombosis:**detachment of part of the thrombus can easily happen resulting in the high risk of pulmonary embolism, especially when the thrombus is present in the right side of the heart.\nSimilarly, if the thrombus originates from the left side of the heart, its partial or complete detachment can cause embolism in other target organs.\n\n**arterial thrombosis:**fragmentation of these thrombi can cause embolism in various organs.\n\n**venous thrombosis:**fragments of these thrombi, which are mainly located in the lower extremities, are also responsible for mainly pulmonary embolism.\nPREVENTION OR THERAPIES Treatment for thrombosis is focused on reducing the possibility of the formation of these abnormal clots, by administering:\n\n**Main antithrombotic therapies:**\noAntiplatelet drugs to prevent arterial thrombosis. oAnticoagulants, like heparin, dicumarolic or activators of the fibrinolytic system (plasminogen activators), to dissolve the clots and prevent venous thrombosis. Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 49 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04\n\n**Thrombus removal:**\noAngioplasty and subsequent placement of a medicated STENT (treated with antiproliferative and antithrombotic factors). (Addition from the web) A stent is a tiny tube that is inserted into a blocked passageway to keep it open. The stent restores the flow of blood or other fluids, depending on where it’s placed.\n\n**Thrombotic disease prevention:**\noRisk factor control focused on the lifestyle: diet (i.g. The Mediterranean diet to prevent hypercholesterolemia and the rupture/ulceration of atherosclerotic plaques), physical activity, smoking, oral contraceptives (in particular when reaching a certain age). EMBOLISM Embolism is the presence in the blood of material, including even components of the blood, that cannot be mixed with the blood itself. Emboli travel through the blood until they encounter vessels that are too small to permit further passage. Therefore, when the size of the vessel is smaller than that of the embolus, it causes a partial or complete vascular occlusion that results in the alteration of the circulation leading to local ischemia and, in worst cases, in tissue infarction in case of total occlusion. In fact, emboli can lodge anywhere in the vascular tree and their clinical consequences depend on:\n\n**position and size of the lodged embolus**\n\n**which vessels is occluded,**\n\n**occluded vessel caliber,**\n\n**vulnerability of the tissue to ischemia,**\n\n**degree and duration of the occlusion and of ischemia,**\n\n**existence or not of collateral blood supply, etc.**\n\n**organ that is not perfused**\nEmbolism, as well as thrombosis, is a frequent cardiovascular problem, commonly leading to death. CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURE/STATE: We can distinguish three different types of emboli depending on their physical states: A.solid, B.fluid, C.gaseous (air). The fluid and gaseous emboli can cause permanent obstruction of small vessels. A. SOLID EMBOLISM, Different types: 1.Thrombotic masses detached from the sites of fragmentation. They are solid masses detached from a thrombus, following fragmentations. We refer to it as “thromboembolism”. As This makes up the 99% of cases, this is the most common type of solid thrombus. Most common systemic emboli (80%) arise from intracardiac mural thrombi, which are present in the chambers of the heart: a.2/3 are present in the left ventricular wall and are associated with left ventricular wall infarction, b.1/3 are associated with left atrial dilatation and fibrillation, c.The remaining emboli originates from aortic aneurysms, atherosclerotic plaques (atherosclerotic debris or cholesterol emboli), valvular vegetations, or venous thrombi. Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 50 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 2. Fragments of pathological tissues (detaching from neoplasms that have permeated the vessels, from endocarditic or atherosclerotic ulcers → the emboli will be composed of some of the necrotic material detached from the plaque), or even from normal tissues (liver cells, marrow cells, etc.). 3. Microscopic and macroscopic parasites and fungi that utilize the circulation to spread: echinococcus, schistosome filarias, ascarids, hookworms, plasmodia, leishmanias, trypanosomes, or from fungi, etc. 4. Foreign bodies of various kinds (needles, bullets, spines, etc.) which have occasionally or accidentally penetrated into the cardiocirculatory system. One of the main risks associated with solid embolism is pulmonary embolism: Pulmonary thromboembolism Pulmonary emboli (PE) mainly originate from deep venous thrombosis of lower extremities (95% of cases), but also from thrombi originating in the right side of the heart, and it is the most common form of thromboembolic disease. It has a high incidence in hospitalized patients that are immobilized in bed, which allows the emboli to be carried through progressively larger veins, reaching the right part of the heart through the vena cava before slamming into the pulmonary arterial vasculature. From a clinical point of view depending on the size and on the artery occluded, the embolus can:\n\n**occlude the main pulmonary artery leading to very severe consequences,**\n\n**stop in the pulmonary artery bifurcation, in this case we are talking about a saddle embolus,**\n\n**pass out into the smaller branching arteries, if smaller in size.**\nQuite frequently, there are often multiple emboli, from one or more thrombi, occurring sequentially or simultaneously as a “shower of smaller emboli” from a single large mass. This shower of smaller emboli can occlude smaller branches of the arteries. In this case for a patient who had one, they are at high risk for more over time. Clinical consequences of pulmonary embolism - In 60-80% of PE cases the emboli are small, making them “clinically silent” as they cannot trigger any clinical manifestations. Later on, small emboli can become organized and be incorporated into the vascular wall that will show fibrosis. In other cases (5% of cases), bulky emboli can obstruct more than 60% of vessels and alter the pulmonary circulation causing sudden death, right heart failure, or cardiovascular collapse, due to the fact that the area is not perfused anymore. Sometimes, the embolic obstruction of medium-sized arteries can cause the vascular rupture and subsequent pulmonary hemorrhage. Normally, we do not talk about pulmonary infarction because the bronchial arteries are sufficient to perfuse the affected area even if the pulmonary arteries are occluded. In other words, the bronchial arterial flow acts as a collateral blood supply that is sufficient at maintaining a basal circulation. If there is a left-sided cardiac failure, the bronchial arterial flow is compromised and leads to a lung infarction. This can also be seen in the occlusion of small end-branches of pulmonary arteries, as they can also result in pulmonary hemorrhages or infarction. Lastly, multiple emboli, over time, can progress towards chronic pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular hypertrophy because of the difficulty for the blood to reach lungs from the heart and therefore there will be an increased workload for the heart → right ventricular failure. Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 51 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 B.FLUID EMBOLISM: consists of 1. lipids and oil material not miscible with blood. In fact, these fats or oil can accidentally penetrate the veins and cause FAT EMBOLISM because of: a.Erroneous intravenous injections of drugs dissolved in oil that should for example go intramuscularly b.Microscopic fat globules, sometimes with associated hematopoietic bone marrow, that have escaped from the adipose tissue after long bone fractures or tissue trauma and burns. This is the most common cause of fat embolism, especially in the elderly population and especially following femoral fractures. As known, elderly long bones contain yellow bone marrow, which contains high amounts of adipose tissue, instead of brown bone marrow. Therefore, after a fracture the risk is the release of yellow marrow into the circulation, which can then occlude the pulmonary and cerebral microvasculature resulting in pulmonary symptoms, etc. Fat embolism occurs in 90% of individuals with severe skeletal injuries but less than 10% of them have clinical findings. Still, the fatality is 5%-15% of cases and fat embolism is considered one of the main causes of death in elderly patients that have fractured their femur. Fig.5 represent an image of fat embolism insufficiency, neurological Fig.5 2. amniotic fluid embolism with introduction of amniotic fluid into maternal venous and pulmonary systems at the time of labor. A: How are these fat emboli resolved physiologically? Q: there are some compensatory mechanism of the body, but these emboli are difficult to be solved by ourselves. In general, it is always better to directly act on it and remove them with therapy treatment (dissolving fats) or surgically (as typically occurs in the lungs). The Professor does not know precisely, however most probably the aim is to dissolve or remove the embolus. C.AIR EMBOLISM: Gas bubbles within the circulation that can obstruct vascular flow and cause distal ischemic injury. A large volume of air, more than 100 cc, in the blood is necessary to produce clinical effects and occlude the vessel. A typical form of gas embolism is the “decompression sickness”, typical condition associated to hyperbaropathy and present especially in scuba and deep-sea divers, underwater construction workers, etc. Two forms of decompression sickness: a. acute // b. chronic a.Focusing more specifically on deep sea and scuba divers, they can develop acute decompression sickness due to the tank full of gases they use. Increased amounts of gas (nitrogen) is dissolved in the blood and tissue when they go deep down underwater. The problem concerns nitrogen, which normally is removed easily via respiration, as the nitrogen changes form from liquid to gas, but in a controlled way and by providing enough time. When divers ascend (depressurize) too quickly without compensation stages, the liquid nitrogen changes its status again via dissolution in the tissue and in the blood and forms gas bubbles and even aggregate together forming bigger bubbles. Different consequences: Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 52 26.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.04 These big gas bubbles spread to skeletal muscles and skeletal tissues, especially accumulating around joints, causing severe pain and necrosis. This occurs especially in the legs. Then, they can reach and stop in the lung vasculature causing edema, hemorrhage, focal emphysema, resulting in severe respiratory distress. In cases in which the gas embolism reaches the heart or brain, patients can die. - b.There is also a chronic form, known as Caisson disease, that mainly affects underwater construction workers (i.g. who may be involved in the construction of tunnels under the sea) and is caused by the persistence of gas emboli in the skeletal system which then generates multiple foci of ischemic necrosis in the femoral heads, tibia, and/or homerus. The treatment consists of placing affected individuals in a hyperbaric chamber (chamber under high pressure) to force gas bubbles back into solution (so to simulate again the change of status of nitrogen from gaseous to liquid). Thanks to a slow decompression, gradual resorption and exhalation of nitrogen can take place to avoid intoxication. CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO THEIR LOCATION: Emboli can never exceed the capillary filter, because of their mass, so they remain located in the left or right circulation section in which they were originated. So if they are in arteries they will stay in arteries and same for veins. In general, an arterial embolus cannot pass into the venous system, and vice versa → so we can distinguish between venous embolism and arterial embolism. On the contrary, very rarely a venous embolism can pass into the arterial circulation due to the presence of a cardiac defect, an interatrial or interventricular defect, that allows its translocation. This is commonly seen in conditions of Patent foramen ovale (PFO). In this consition, the foramen ovale did not close properly at birth. Therefore, in these patients, venous emboli can go into arterial circulation by passing through the foramen. We can have:\n\n**Arterial embolisms:**most severe, it is responsible for ischemic necrosis or infarction of various organs whose arteries are occluded, such as heart or brain. It is one of the most common causes of death, especially when the embolus occludes major arteries.\n\n**Venous embolisms:**even if they are not as severe as the previous ones, they usually reach the lungs, which is the most affected organ, causing pulmonary embolism (main cause of death in hospitalized patients). They origin from deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities and then travel to the lungs where they lodge. This is different from arterial emboli, which instead travel to a wide variety of different sites.\nVenous embolism mainly affects the lungs. While the arterial ones can reach any organ in our body. Following the effects of gravity in arterial embolism: - Arterial emboli in 60-70% of the cases will stop in the legs (of course less dangerous than in other cases); - 10-20% in the brain; - the remaining in the intestine, kidneys, spleen and upper extremities. The Professor advised us to watch the following videos: Platelet activation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8JMfbYW2p4 Thrombosis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW6WscFqli8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vVqBjk-oqQ Nikola Pavlos, Alice Bertozzi 53", "input": "", "output": "Thrombosis and Embolism\n\n**What causes thrombosis?**\nThe primary abnormalities that lead to thrombosis are the so-called Virchow triad 1. endothelial injury 2. stasis or turbulent blood flow 3. hypercoagulability of the blood\n\n**What damages the endothelium?**\nInflammation, toxins (smoking), hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocyteinemia, physical injury, abnormal blood flow, etc.\n\n**By which mechanism does endothelial injury cause thrombosis?**\nInjury to ECs cause them to switch their gene expression to a procoagulant one down-regulation of Thrombomodulin, Protein C, and Tissue Factor Protein inhibitor. secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs), which limit fibrinolysis, and downregulate the expression of t-PA.\n\n**By which mechanism does turbulence cause thrombosis?**\nTurbulence contributes to arterial and cardiac thrombosis by causing endothelial injury or dysfunction as well as by forming countercurrents that contribute to local pockets of stasis (Different from stasis of the venous circulation that is more generalized and a major contributor to the development of venous thrombi) Normal blood flow is laminar such that the platelets (and other blood cellular elements) flow centrally in the vessel lumen, separated from the endothelium by a slower moving layer of plasma. Turbulence and stasis therefore: Promote endothelial activation, enhancing procoagulant activity and leukocyte adhesion, in part through flow- induced changes in the expression of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory factors Disrupt laminar flow and bring platelets into contact with the endothelium Prevent washout and dilution of activated clotting factors by fresh flowing blood and the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors\n\n**What can cause turbulence or similar blood flow alterations that**\npromote thrombosis? atherosclerotic plaque → turbulence Atrial fibrillation, dilated atrium → stasis (major) Aneurysms→ stasis Sickle cell anemia→ stasis Hyper viscosity→ stasis\n\n**What are the possible causes of hypercoagulability?**\nHypercoagulability refers to an abnormally high tendency of the blood to clot, and is typically caused by alterations in coagulation factors. Hypercoagulability has a particularly important role in venous thrombosis and can be divided into primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) disorders (Table 4.2). Of the inherited causes of hypercoagulability,\n\n****\n\n**Describe the morphology of different thrombi**\nArterial or cardiac thrombi usually begin at sites of turbulence or endothelial injury, whereas venous thrombi characteristically occur at sites of stasis. Thrombi are focally attached to the underlying vascular surface, particularly at the point of initiation.. The propagating portion of a thrombus is often poorly attached and therefore prone to fragmentation and embolization. Mural thrombi: Thrombi in heart chambers or in the aortic lumen Risk factors: abnormal myocardial contraction (arrhythmias, dilated cardiomyopathy, or MI) or endomyocardial injury (myocarditis or catheter trauma) In the aorta they frequently develop from ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque and aneurysmal dilation.\n\n**Vegetations**\nthrombi on heart valves may be infected or sterile Blood-borne bacteria or fungi can adhere to previously damaged valves or may cause valve damage directly; in either case, endothelial injury and disturbed blood flow can induce the formation of large thrombotic masses Sterile vegetations can develop on hypercoagulable states (nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis)\n\n**Arterial thrombi → WHITE THROMBI**\nfrequently occlusive, most common sites: coronary, cerebral, and femoral arteries. Morphology: meshwork of platelets, fibrin, red cells, and degenerating leukocytes, grow retrograde TOWARDS THE HEART usually superimposed on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Other vascular injuries (vasculitis, trauma) may be the underlying cause. Commonly found in: coronary, cerebral and femoral arteries\n\n**Venous thrombosis (phlebothrombosis) → RED THROMBI**\nalmost always occlusive. contain more red cells and relatively few platelets (red thrombi). They are firm, focally attached to the vessel wall, and contain lines of Zahn ( pale platelet and fibrin deposits alternating with darker red cell–rich layers), Such laminations signify that a thrombus has formed in flowing blood, features that help distinguish them from postmortem clots . 90% of cases happen in veins of lower extremities. extend in the direction of blood flow; thus both propagate toward the heart Superficial venous thrombi affect the saphenous vein in the presence of varicose veins (varicosities): local pain, congestion, swelling, tenderness varicose ulcers. Rare embolization DVT affect the popliteal, femoral, iliac veins: asymptomatic in 50% of cases; local pain and edema in the remaining cases. More serious because they can embolize → pulmonary embolism They occur in stasis and hypercoagulability states: bed immobilization, congestive heart failure, tumors, trauma, advanced age.\n\n**Postmortem clots**\ngelatinous and have a dark-red dependent portion where red cells have settled by gravity and a yellow “chicken fat” upper portion, and are usually not attached to the underlying vessel wall.\n\n**Describe the evolution of a thrombus**\nIf a patient survives the initial thrombosis, in the ensuing days to weeks thrombi undergo some combination of the following four events: 1. Propagation: thrombi accumulate additional platelets and fibrin 2. Embolization: thrombi dislodge and travel to other sites in the vasculature 3. Dissolution: the result of fibrinolysis → rapid shrinkage and total disappearance of recent thrombi. Extensive fibrin deposition and cross-linking in older thrombi render them more resistant to lysis. This distinction explains why therapeutic administration of fibrinolytic agents such as t-PA (e.g., in the setting of acute coronary thrombosis) is generally effective only when given during the first few hours of a thrombotic event. 4. Organization and recanalization: Older thrombi become organized by the ingrowth of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Capillary channels eventually form that reestablish the continuity of the original lumen, albeit to a variable degree. Continued recanalization may convert a thrombus into a smaller mass of connective tissue that becomes incorporated into the vessel wall. Eventually, with remodeling and contraction of the mesenchymal elements, only a fibrous lump may remain to mark the original thrombus\n\n**Clinical presentation of thrombosis?**\nThrombi come to clinical attention when they obstruct arteries or veins, or give rise to emboli. The clinical presentation depends on the involved site. Venous thrombi can cause: painful congestion and edema distal to an obstruction pulmonary embolism arterial thrombi can embolize and cause downstream infarctions occlusion of a critical vessel (e.g., a coronary or cerebral artery)→ infarction\n\n**Prevention and Treatment of thrombosis**\nMain antithrombotic therapies: Antiplatelet drugs (Aspirin) Anticoagulants (heparin, dicumarolic) Activators of the fibrinolytic system (plasminogen activators)\n\n**Thrombus removal:**\nAngioplasty and subsequent placement of a medicated STENT (with antiproliferative and antithrombotic factors)\n\n**Thrombotic disease prevention:**\nRisk factor control (diet, hypercholesterolemia, physical activity, lifestyle, smoking, oral contraceptives, etc.)\n\n**What is an embolus?**\nAn embolus is a detached intravascular solid, liquid, or gaseous mass that is carried by the blood from its point of origin to a distant site, until they encounter vessels too small to permit further passage, causing partial or complete vascular occlusion→ tissue dysfunction or infarction. The vast majority of emboli are dislodged thrombi, hence the term thromboembolism. Other rare emboli are composed of fat droplets, nitrogen bubbles, atherosclerotic debris (cholesterol emboli), tumor fragments, bone marrow, or even foreign bodies.\n\n**Describe solid emboli**\n99% of solid emboli derive from thrombotic fragmentation and are called thromboemboli. The remaining 1%: 1. fragments of pathological tissues (detaching from neoplasms that have permeated the vessels, from endocarditic or atherosclerotic ulcers, etc.) or even from normal tissues (liver cells, marrow cells, etc.) 2. micro- and macroscopic parasites (echinococcus, schistosome filarias, ascarids, hookworms, plasmodia, leishmanias, 2. trypanosomes) or from fungi, etc. 3. foreign bodies of various kinds (needles, bullets, spines, etc.) occasionally penetrated into the heart or vessels\n\n**Fragmentation of the thrombus is more frequent in the case of white thrombus but it can also occur in red thrombi.**\nArteries: Most systemic emboli (80%) arise from mural thrombi of the heart chambers: 2/3 associated with left ventricular wall infarcts 1/3 associated with left atrial dilatation and fibrillation\n\n**The remaining systemic emboli originate from aortic aneurysms, atherosclerotic plaques (atherosclerotic debris or cholesterol emboli), valvular vegetations, or venous thrombi**\nVeins: The most common type of thromboembolic disease is Pulmonary emboli (PE) which in 95% of cases originates from deep venous thrombosis of lower extremities Fragmented thrombi from DVT reach the pulmonary circulation and Depending on the size of the embolus, it can occlude the main pulmonary artery the pulmonary artery bifurcation (saddle embolus) the branching arteries.\n\n**Frequently there are multiple emboli, occurring either sequentially or simultaneously as a shower of smaller emboli from a single large mass; in general, the patient who has had one PE is at high risk for more.**\nRarely, a venous embolus passes through an interatrial or interventricular defect and gains access to the systemic arterial circulation (paradoxical embolism)\n\n**Describe fat emboli**\nPossible causes erroneous i.v. injections of drugs dissolved in oil fat cells escape from adipose tissue or yellow bone marrow fractures of long bones → frequent in elderly tissue trauma (surgeries) burns. It occurs in 90% of individuals with severe skeletal injuries but less then 10% of them have clinical findings\n\n**Risk of occlusion of pulmonary and cerebral microvasculature. Fatal in 5%-15% of cases**\n\n**Describe air emboli**\nAir embolism consist of: Gas bubbles within the circulation, which can obstruct vascular flow and cause distal ischemic injury A large volume of air (>100 cc) in the blood is necessary to produce clinical effects A form of gas embolism called decompression sickness Deep sea dive (high pressure) increased amounts of nitrogen dissolved in the blood. When divers ascends (depressurizes) too quickly without compensation stages: nitrogen comes out of solution in the tissue and in the blood (Hyperbaropathy). Gas bubbles spread to skeletal muscles and skeletal tissues (around joints): severe pain. Gas bubbles in the lung vasculature cause edema, hemorrhage, focal atelectesia or emphysema respiratory distress Chronic form: caisson disease (pressurized vessels used in bridge construction; workers in these vessels suffered of decompression sickness) persistence of gas emboli in the skeletal system multiple foci of ischemic necrosis (common sites: femoral heads, tibia, and homerus)\n\n**Treatment:**hyperbaric chamber"}

They can be associated with the response of the host to the tumor, and the manifestation can be in all of the body, also far from the tumor location.They are present in a high percentage (20-40%) of tumor patients and are not dependent on the stage of the malignancy, since they can develop in any step of the neoplasia. They can have subjective symptoms depending on the individual. They are often linked to malignant tumors. The diagnosis is important, also because some symptoms can be similar to other diseases. They are especially associated with some types of cancers, such as lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer. There are also specific paraneoplastic syndromes linked to diseases of the skin and hematological cancers. MAIN MECHANISMS FOR PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES The mechanisms by which these diseases occur are:\n\n**Tumors (hormones-dependent paraneoplastic syndromes) that act by producing hormones ectopically (in a different location from the normal one) or even from tissues that normally do not produce hormones. What is produced is not only hormones, but also molecules associated with the hormone responses (receptors for example) or molecules that are not hormones in the structure, but they are similar chemically (hormone-like substances) that act as ligands for the hormone receptors. So they can be in general active compounds that, directly or indirectly, can cause the symptoms of the paraneoplastic syndromes.**\nFor example, Adenocarcinoma is an epithelial malignant tumor that develops from the glandular tissue but can also develop from parenchymal cells that are not able to secrete hormones. The prefix “adeno-” is associated to the ability of this tumor tissue to produce hormones ectopically. This is due to cell alterations, such as the change of receptors on surface of cancer cells, the release of compounds that cause symptoms in tissues that are far from the cancer.\n\n**Deficiency of normal factors, and therefore this is not associated to hormones paraneoplastic syndromes but to other important molecules such as calcium or glucose. In this case, we lose functions. For example, the inactivation of some surface receptors.**\n\n**The host responseto the tumor, especially consequences of humoral or cellular immune mechanisms.**\nIn this case, paraneoplastic syndromes are in general neurological, diseases associated with CNS or PNS. Many of these syndromes are due to the production of substances that are associated with pathological gene activation by the tumors. This abnormality can lead to activation of immune response and result in autoimmune disease. Remember - every single cell of the body has a complete genome, consisting of about 30,000 genes; however, only a fraction of the genes is expressed (around 1%), while the other genes are not transcribed and remain silent. In these syndromes, we have the expression of abnormal genes, for example of ectopic hormones or hormones similar but not identical to the ones that are normally produced. PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES CLASSIFICATION The paraneoplastic syndromes can be roughly divided into two categories:\n\n**Simple paraneoplastic syndromes:**main category, associated to specific symptoms and particular types of tissue that are involved and are named after the type of tissue where these diseases are present\nSara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 32 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 (neurologic, endocrine-metabolic, rheumatic, osteoarticular, dermatological, hematological, vascular and nephrological diseases).\n\n**Complex paraneoplastic syndromes:**cachexia, anorexia, fever. One of the paraneoplastic syndromes that we have already seen is cachexia, and also fever due to the presence of the tumor is a type of paraneoplastic syndrome.\nA very general classification of the more frequent paraneoplastic syndromes depending on the type of the tissues is:\n\n**nephrological only 5% of patients.**\n\n**neurological disorders in more than 10% of patients.**\n\n**rheumatic-osteoarticular in more than 15% of patients.**\n\n**dermatological in more than 15% of patients.**\n\n**hematological-vascular in more than 15% of patients.**\n\n**endocrine-metabolic:**the most frequent (40%).\nAPPENDIX I want to underline the difference between the increase in hormones production, associated with benign tumors that don’t cause paraneoplastic syndromes, and the ectopic production of hormones, which is typical of paraneoplastic syndromes due to malignant tumors. (Fig. 1) Here are some symptoms that we can see in an adenoma. The professor reads fig. 1 fig.1 ENDOCRINEPARANEOPLASTICSYNDROMES Adenomas are able to produce in excess the GH, ACTH, TSH and so on, without causing a paraneoplastic syndrome. This is because the adenohypophysis is a glandular tissue, and the production is not ectopic. Depending on the hormone in excess, the tumor induces some symptoms and diseases. These secretions are due especially to benign tumors of glands that can produce in excess the different types of hormones, but they are not ectopic productions. Sara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 33 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 The same symptoms seen in fig. 1 can be seen also in paraneoplastic syndromes by malignant tumors, but in this case the production of hormones is ectopic from non-glandular tissues. They can produce substances that can inactivate precursors of hormones or that can increase them. Or substances that are inactive hormones precursors with only a small part of the biological activity compared to the one of the mature hormone. In particular, they are associated with small cell lung cancer and the ectopic production of ACTH, ADH, calcitonin and others. For instance, ACTH produced in excess by adenohypophysis probably induces Cushing's Syndrome, but in this case, we are in the presence of a benign tumor. Why do I underline Cushing’s Syndrome? Because there is a paraneoplastic Cushing’s Syndrome due to the fact that other tumors, that are not at the level of the adenohypophysis, are able to produce this excess of ACTH and induce a Cushing’s Syndrome that is similar to the normal one, but in this case, it is a paraneoplastic syndrome. The paraneoplastic is due to ectopic hormone production and the tumor has a malignant phenotype. These substances can also be inactive substances, or they can be hormone precursors produced in excess. In general, they are present in malignant tumors. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND TESTS To identify endocrine-metabolic paraneoplastic syndromes and distinguish them from symptoms due to benign tumors:\n\n**Recognize an endocrine syndrome associated with a non-endocrine tumor. So, understand if these types of symptoms can be associated to an adenoma or another type of tumor.**\n\n**Understand the high blood/urinary levels of hormones.**\n\n**Decrease in blood/urinary levels of the hormone after the removal of the tumor with surgery.**\n\n**Recurrence of hormone dosage in case of tumor recurrence (if, after tumor removal through surgery, the levels of the hormone decrease, but then the tumor comes back and the levels of the hormone in blood/urine increase again).**\n\n**Absence of disease in the endocrine-related organ. In this case, it’s possible that the increase of hormonal levels in blood or urine is due to an ectopic production.**\n\n**Remission/recurrence of the syndrome with tumor treatment/recurrence.**\nThere are also some diagnostic tests from the laboratory that allow us to understand if these productions of hormones are associated or not with paraneoplastic syndromes:\n\n**Evaluation of the gradient (= increase or decrease of the production) of the hormone between tumor and peripheral veins, so understand how the hormone is produced by the tumor in association to its presence in the veins.**\n\n**Extraction of the hormone from neoplastic tissue by biopsy.**\n\n**Determination of hormonal activity with biological tests such as RIA (radio-immune assay), important because it is very specific and it also evaluates very low levels of hormones in the body, and also immunological tests such as immunohistochemistry.**\n\n**Biochemical characterization of peptides and other molecules produced by the tumor with a biochemical analysis**\n\n**In vitro demonstration of hormonal production by cancer cells, for example in a primary culture (produced directly by the primary tumor. When inserted in a medium, they are able to grow and replicate for only 2-3 cycles and then they are not able to continue the line. In contrast, continuous cell lines are able to proliferate for years and years because they are a particular type of tumoral cells with mutations**\nSara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 34 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 on some genes associated with proliferation ex. p53, that allow them to continuously proliferate). In this case, in vitro demonstration, primary cell culture is required, and they proliferate for only 2-3 cycles, but is enough for the pathologist to demonstrate the production of associated hormones into the medium.\n\n**Identification of hormonal mRNA in the tissue or cell culture by real-time PCR (that is used also to amplify the viral sequences, for instance in Covid). In this case it is used to amplify the mRNA to get a high quantity of it, so that it can be analyzed.**\nECTOPIC HORMONE PRODUCTION Paraneoplastic syndromes due to ectopic hormone production are classified according to the hormone produced ectopically:\n\n**ACTH and ADH (especially in small cell lung cancer).**\n\n**Growth hormone GH**\n\n**Parathormone (Parathyroid hormone or PTH) (squamous cell carcinoma of the kidney, ovary, bladder).**\n\n**Calcitonin (breast cancer, lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer).**\n\n**Insulin.**\nECTOPIC PRODUCTION OF ACTH It induces a paraneoplastic disease similar to Cushing’s Syndrome called paraneoplastic Cushing’s Syndrome, and especially it can be related to small cell lung cancer (50% of cases), but also to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors such as of the islet cells and others (10%) and medullary thyroid cancer (5%). There is an ectopic hypersecretion of ACTH, usually produced by the anterior pituitary, but obviously this also has effect on the adrenal cortex and induces secretion of cortisol. In some cases, there may also be the production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), a precursor of ACTH (already seen in cachexia in the Basic Pathology course. POMC is associated to cachexia because is linked to the glycolysis and the decrease of the adipose tissue. Its production is induced by Leptin). It increased in cancer patients (with ectopic production) and notin patients with Cushing’s Syndrome. The symptoms of the paraneoplastic Cushing’s syndrome are very similar to the ones of the Cushing’s disease. The main difference is that while the latter is chronic, the paraneoplastic syndrome is acute. Clinical features of (non-paraneoplastic) Cushing’s Syndrome include:\n\n**Obesity (one of the main features).**\n\n**Moon face (one of the main features).**\n\n**Loss of muscle mass and strength.**\n\n**High blood pressure (hypertension).**\n\n**Alterations in the skin, that is fragile and bruises easily.**\n\n**Thicker or more visible body and facial hair (hirsutism).**\nThese were the clinical features of (non-paraneoplastic) Cushing’s Syndrome. Since paraneoplastic syndromes are generally due to malignancies, these types of syndromes have not enough time to induce all of the clinical features into the patients, they are acute. So, we see only the early phase symptoms. Therefore, the main symptoms present in a paraneoplastic Cushing’s Syndrome, due to the rapid onset of the malignancy,are: - first of all hypertension Sara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 35 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 decrease in blood levels electrolytes like potassium (hypokalemia), therefore those symptoms associated with muscles (cramps, weakness) and also weight loss So, in this case there is no obesity and moon face that are associated only with the non-paraneoplastic Cushing’s Syndrome since in paraneoplastic one only fast symptoms show (hypertension first of all). ECTOPIC PRODUCTION OF GH Another ectopic production is associated with GH(or somatotropin), which is very rare and present in a very low percentage among the paraneoplastic syndromes. It is usually due to the secretion of GHRH (GH Releasing Hormone) which increases the GH's production and secretion from the anterior pituitary lobe. It can be due to different times of cancers (like pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors), but especially lung cancer (bronchial carcinoids) GH in generally induces acromegaly, different from gigantism (gigantism is a proportioned growth of each part of the body and it occurs generally in the first years of the life or even in morphogenesis, while acromegaly is just accumulation of the hormone that induces a disproportionate growth in some parts of the body), because there is a major probability that this type of paraneoplastic syndrome can occur in adulthood. ECTOPIC PRODUCTION OF ADH Another paraneoplastic syndrome is due to the ectopic production of ADH. This syndrome is called syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). It is associated again with small cell lung cancer (in 60% of cases, secretion of a hormone similar to vasopressin)but also to hypothalamic tumors (secretion of vasopressin). The physiological role of ADH is to increase water reabsorption from renal tubules when there is hypovolemia (low volume in blood), that also means dehydration, so vasopressin induces reabsorption of water in blood. In this case it is considered inappropriate because secretion of ADH is also present even if we have normovolemia, so it is not induced by a demand of the body. In case of this paraneoplastic syndrome, we have two characteristic features that are hyponatremia ([Na+] < 135 mEq/L) and hypoosmolarityin plasma (less than 270 mOsm/L)associated with urine hyperosmolarity. The normal concentration of urine has a specific weight of about 1007-1030, but in case of urine hyperosmolarity this value is higher due to the increased concentration of sodium in it (increase of more than 40 mEq/L from the normal value that ranges from 40-220 mEq/L) despite hyponatremia. SIADH clinical features are related to both the degree of hyponatremia and to its time and rate of onset. Associated symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and seizures. What is important is that SIADH is characterized by absence of edema and hypovolemia, since it’s an inappropriate production. HYPERCALCEMIA Other types of paraneoplastic syndromes may be due to the alteration in calcium level (occurring in 15-20 cases over 100000), calcium production or the induction of PTH production. Hypercalcemia is not focused on particular types of tumors(T-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, bronchogenic carcinoma, spinocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, kidney, ovarian and gallbladder carcinoma), but in general it can be seen in the latter steps of tumors, since it can be due to osteolysis, damage of bones that induces release of calcium, for example due to multiple myeloma (the main cause), or bone metastases derived from other tumors. Sara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 36 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 Hypercalcemia can be due to increased production of pro-inflammatory humoral factors, for example cytokines such as IL-6, TGF-α and β (especially in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, so metastatization), TNF-α (especially produced in case of T-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma). Also, there is anincrease in the levels of PTH-like protein(ubiquitous, but rare in normal tissues), that is structurally different from PTH but it is able to bind to its receptors and act as a ligand. The increase in this protein can induce hypercalcemia because it increases reabsorption of calcium in blood at the level of the bone (increased osteolysis) and decreases calcium excretion from the kidneys, therefore there is an increase in the blood calcemia. Calcium levels are normally 8.5-10.5 mg/dL, and if they increase it can cause confusion, lethargy, nausea, and constipation (values between 12 and 14 mg/dL) and if they increase even more, it can cause coma. HYPOCALCEMIA Hypocalcemia is more related to lung and breast carcinoma and is due to the secretion of calcitonin by the thyroid, which inhibits the reabsorption and increases the renal excretion of calcium, the opposite of PTH. Therefore, there is an alteration of the neuronal transmission. Symptoms that are often not even present, associated with hypocalcemia are related to muscles such as tetany, fasciculation, and hyperreflexia. HYPOGLYCEMIA Hypoglycemia can be also associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, and it is especially due to gastrointestinal tumors such as hepatocellular and adrenocortical carcinomas in very low quantities (23% and 10%, respectively), and mesenchymal tumors in the majority (45%). This is due to the production of an insulin-like growth factor, also called big IGF-II due to its high molecular weight, that stimulates the entry of glucose into tumor cells by inhibiting hepatic glucose uptake. HEMATOLOGICAL PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES Hematological paraneoplastic syndromes can be due to anemias in general, since most of the tumors induce alterations in the number of blood cells. So, we can see red cells aplasia, anemia, erythrocytosis, leukemoid reaction, eosinophilia, or basophilia. This kind of effects can be associated with different types of cancers. Alternatively, they can induce coagulopathies (alterations in coagulation steps) and the presence of hypercoagulability. This can be due to tumors or because of cancer treatment. Clinical manifestations usually include deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Another important feature in coagulopathies of cancer patients is DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which is a pathological coagulation that can induce thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. DIC is seen especially in leukemias, especially a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia prostate cancer. This type of DIC can also be associated for example to thrombotic endocarditis, in patients that suffer from mucoid tumors (for example in GI tract) that produce mucus. The hyperproduction of mucus induces thrombus due to the presence of floating mucus. This type of thrombus can reach the endocardium and induce thrombotic endocarditis, which is non-bacterial but due to the mucus. This is called marantic endocarditis. Clinical manifestations include vessel occlusions in the periphery, embolism that leads to occlusion of nervous system vessels with acute neurological deficit and encephalopathy. Thromboembolism is also associated to thrombosis in superficial veins due to presence of mucins, so due to DIC. This is also called Trousseau syndrome, associated to thrombophlebitis, especially to thrombophlebitis migraines, also called migratory thrombophlebitis since it induces thrombi in the circulation determining phlebitis. Note from the sbobinatore: last year, the professor explained the previous topics in much greater detail, which also reflects what is found in the slides. The material skipped can be found below. Sara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 37 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 One in particular among the coagulopathies is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is a complication in patients with Hodgkin’s Disease because it also induces an autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Anemias in general depending on alteration in erythrocytes, or alteration in hemoglobin, or alteration in ferric cytochrome, are very common and they can be also normocytic (dimension of RBCs is normal) and normochromic (color of RBCs is normal). The normal range of serum iron (50-150 mg/dL) is unchanged or decreased, while the ferritin in the blood (male 30 -120; female 30 - 260 ng/mL) is unchanged or slightly decreased. HEMATOLOGICAL PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES:AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can be due to host response, so in this case the activation of the autoimmune response by the host that induces this anemia mediated by:\n\n**warm antibodies (IgG) activated in warm temperatures especially in the B cell lymphomas and leukemias. In this case hemolysis is extravascular, it consists of phagocytosis in the spleen.**\n\n**cold antibodies (IgM) activated in cold temperatures and attack erythrocytes as autoantibodies. In this case hemolysis is intravascular.**\nSigns and symptoms are related to small vessels’ occlusion such as acrocyanosis (blue color in the periphery) of hands, feet or face (ears and nose) but generally in all the peripheral parts of the body and is due to a decrease in the blood flow. HEMATOLOGICAL PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES:ERYTHROCYTOSIS Sometimes tumors produce erythrocytosis (polycythemia) and is due especially to increase in synthesis of erythropoietin, normally secreted by the kidneys and induces the production and the maturation of erythrocytes It is associated with cerebellar hemangioblastoma (20%), renal adenoma and renal cyst (15%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (15%) but it is not so easy to see this type of paraneoplastic syndrome since erythrocytosis is much more frequently due to anemia. HEMATOLOGICAL PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES:LEUKEMOID REACTION There is also the leukemoid reaction that is similar to the erythroid and is induced by the overproduction of particular types of growth factors that induce the production and increase in maturation of leukocytes in particular those associated with stimulation of maturation of granulocytes, so granulocytes colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and other types of growth factor or interleukins, in particular interleukin 3 (IL-3). HEMATOLOGICAL PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES:COAGULOPATHIES We also have coagulopathies due to the induction of coagulation, and these occur normally closer to the tumor that induces itself a block, so it induces thrombosis or can induce, in case of lung cancer, the pulmonary embolism. The main damage is DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) that can complicate metastatic tumor course and is often present in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (but with leukemias in general, and with prostate cancer. HEMATOLOGICAL PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES:NONBACTERIAL THROMBOTIC ENDOCARDITIS Sara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 38 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 Due to the presence of thrombi, but also due to the presence of the tumor mass in general. In some patients can occur another type of damage which is nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, also called marantic endocarditis because this type of endocarditis is due to a tumor, not bacterial, and there is an increased secretion of mucus. In this case the primary tumor that can induce a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is lung adenocarcinoma, but also other tissues able to produce mucus such as intestines and ovaries. Due to this production of mucus that induces the thrombus there is an occlusion in the vessels, in particular in the peripheral parts (acute peripheral arterial occlusion). Therefore you can see clinical manifestation as encephalopathy and acute neurological deficits in the case in which the occlusion is at the level of the vessels in the brain. HEMATOLOGICAL PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES:THROMBOVASCULAR ACCIDENT Another particular type of paraneoplastic syndrome is Trousseau’s Syndrome, the thromboembolism, also called migratory thrombophlebitis, that is a damage due to the increase in mucus level, also induced by nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis and coagulopathies in general. Pathogenesis is not completely clear, but it may be due to the activation of serine proteases that activate factor X and trigger the coagulation pathway. PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES OF THE KIDNEYS About paraneoplastic syndromes of the kidney, they are due especially to immune complexes in response to the tumor by the host, that are considered as autoimmune damage. However, they have not been studied enough and they are not well known. This is a slide (fig.2) where some of them are listed only to give a flash on this type of paraneoplastic syndromes, but there are many different types, some very rare, others more frequent. The syndromes are usually due especially to the damage of the renal tissue due to the response of the host. They can be present in patients with colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and lymphomas due to circulating immune complexes. fig.2 PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROMES The other important is the association with neurological diseases due to the host defense, so the activation of autoimmune immunoglobins (host response). They are present in a high percentage (70%) when there is small cell lung tumor. Sara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 39 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROMES:LAMBERT-EATON One of the main ones is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which is due to autoimmune antibodies against channels for the passage of calcium, the P/Q channels. These antibodies anti-P/Q, decrease the quantity of calcium that enters in nervous cells, causing a decrease in acetylcholine release at the level of neuromuscular junctions, and therefore a decrease in transmission of the signal leading to weakness in muscles. Lambert-Eaton is a myasthenic syndrome since it is very similar to myasthenia gravis- a genetic disease cause absence of the receptors for acetylcholine and that induces weakness in muscle. The symptoms of these two conditions are the same, but the cause is different. In Lambert Eaton we have damage of the channels, but the acetylcholine receptors are functional. On the other hand, in myasthenia there is damage of acetylcholine receptors, so signal transmission does not happen even with the right concentration of acetylcholine released. So, in both there is an alteration of muscle contraction. There are also some other differences, since Lambert-Eaton:\n\n**Typically involves particular types of muscles, the ones of the proximal arms and legs.**\n\n**In very few cases induces weakness and damages in the bulbar muscles of the eyes.**\n\n**The main difference is that in case of repeated stimulation of the muscles the strength of the contraction increases each time while this does not occur in case of myasthenia.**\n\n**With electromyography (EMG):**repeated stimuli lead to sufficient delivery of calcium induced release of acetylcholine and contraction, while in myasthenia gravis nothing happens since receptors still don’t function. This is very important for the diagnosis.\nPARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROMES:ENCELOPHATY Paraneoplastic encephalopathy is associated with the production of ANNA (anti-neuronal nuclear autoantibodies) that are increased in response to small cell lung cancerbut also breast cancer and they are type 1 (anti-HU) and type 2. ANNA can also be increased when there is also an autoimmune disease (for example, in Multiple Sclerosis), not only in the case of a tumor. It is possible to see if a patient has an autoimmune disease by evaluating these antinuclear autoantibodies. Effects of this encephalopathy on the CNS are dementia and seizures. PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROMES:OTHER NEUROPATHIES The other neuropathies are divided in sensory and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathies depending on the type of nerves that in the PNS are affected:\n\n**They are sensory if we have a degeneration or a loss of the neurons in the dorsal and posterior horns of the spinal cord. They are generally related to small cell lung cancer. Cerebellar and brainstem degeneration are variable. Symptoms are both sensory and psychological, they include anxiety, depression, amnesia, dizziness, confusion, hallucination, and behavioral abnormalities. In some patients, ANNA-1 antibodies are detected in the blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid.**\n\n**In case of loss of neurons of the anterior horns of the spinal cord, we have sensorimotor neuropathy. It is the more frequent long-distance effect produced by cancer on the peripheral nervous system. Again, in this case it is related to small cell lung cancer and ANNA-1 are involved. Signs and symptoms include distal sensorimotor neuropathy fatigue, slight strength deficit, hypoesthesia, or absent distal reflexes. It can be due to malnutrition, but it doesn't respond well to nutritional therapy.**\nSara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 40 29.03.2023 BIASI L.4 PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROMES:CEREBELLAR SYNDROME The last one associated with the nervous system is the paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome that induces severeataxia, a very intense sense of fatigue responsible for the progressive disturbances in carrying out voluntary, planned movements by the extremities and the eyes, and this can start as symmetric disturbances but then it becomes asymmetric. Symptoms are related to a lack of muscle control and of movement coordination and to a defective sense of equilibrium due to damage to the cerebellum. Cerebellar syndrome is related to small cell lung carcinoma and ANNA-1 are involved but, in this case, there is also another type of antibody that is Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 (anti-Yo or PCA1). PCA1 are against Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and induce their necrosis. Therefore, any attempt to treat, such as immunotherapy used against these antibodies, is unable to counteract the damage because the cerebellar Purkinje cells are destroyed. PARANEOPLASTIC SKIN SYNDROMES Other paraneoplastic syndromes affect the skin. They are especially associated with hematological diseases and are considered collateral diseases in paraneoplastic syndromes. They are precancerous. Pigmented skin lesions or keratosis are: - Acanthosis nigricans (associated with gastric cancer): dark, round skin lesion. They are especially found in skin folds (like inguinal folds). Can be related to different types of cancer. The etiopathogenesis appears to be immunological due to the hypersecretion of epidermal growth factor. However, it is not sure. Generalized melanosis (associated with lymphoma, melanoma, HCC) - Bowen’s disease (associated with lung and gastric cancers): it is an in situ carcinoma but can occur also as a paraneoplastic syndrome when linked to other cancers. Leser-Trélat sign (associated with lymphomas and gastric cancer): Onset of multiple seborrheic keratoses that increase in number and size. It is also associated with Acanthosis, as they often occur together. Other skin syndromes are: - Sweet syndrome or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (linked to hemolymphopoietic cancers): Characterized by fever due to increase of neutrophils production which induces erythematous nodules - Palmar hyperkeratosis (related to T-cell-non-Hodgkin lymphomas): stratum corneum degeneration - Ichthyosis (linked to Hodgkin lymphomas): Hyperkeratosis with “fish-like” skin with scales that lift up. Paraneoplastic syndromes often are also precancerous conditions, so there is a difference in the timing: they can be both precancerous and paraneoplastic, so associated with other types of cancer. This type of classification is the main one, but others also exist. Each type may also have severe subclassifications. Sara Schiffini, Lan Sandra Trinh 41", "input": "", "output": "Paraneoplastic syndromes\n\n**what are paraneoplastic syndromes?Paraneoplastic syndromes are different types of diseases that are associated with the presence of a tumor but that manifest in regions that are unrelated to the anatomical distribution of the tumor or its metastasis.They are present in up to 40% of cancer (mainly lung, GI, skin and blood cancers) patients and can develop at any stage of the neoplastic growth:**preceding neoplasia diagnosis, corresponding to celldissemination or tumor relapsing, or it can worsen the course of the disease itself.\n\n**what are the main mechanisms of paraneoplastic syndrome?**\n1. excessive or ectopic production of hormones, or other physiologically active compounds. 2. deficiency of normal factors such as calcium or glucose host response to the tumor (main way in which neurological 3.paraneoplastic syndrome presents)\n\n**how are paraneoplastic syndromes classified?Paraneoplastic Syndromes can be roughly divided into two types:**\nSimple paraneoplastic syndromes: named after the particullar type of tissue where these diseases are present (neurologic, endocrine-metabolic, rheumatic, osteoarticular, dermatological, hematological, vascular and nephrological diseases).

POMC is associated with lipolysis in cachexia and leptin stimulates its production. signs and symptoms are different too, due to rapid onset there is no obesity or moon face, but rather weight loss. high BP Hypokalemia → muscle cramping and weakness Paraneoplastic HypercalcemiaHypercalcemia is probably the most common type ofparaneoplastic syndrome, in fact, symptomatic hypercalcemia is more often related to cancer than to hyperparathyroidism.Associated cancers: T-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, squamous cell carcinoma of the lungDue to a production of IL-1 TGF-α, TNF-α and Parathyroid-hormone related protein (PTHRP) that acts like PTH (induces bone reabsorption and decreases renal calcium excretion) symptoms include confusion, lethargy, nausea, coma.osteolysis can also be induced by cancer, whether primary in the bone as in multiple myeloma, or metastatic to bone. Paraneoplastic (SIADH)remember: vasopressin = ADHMajor forms of underlying cancer: small cell lung cancer, intracranial neoplasms.Inappropriate release of ADH (even with euvolemia). SIADH is characterized by absence of edema and hypervolemia.As a result, there’s dilutional Hyponatremia ([Na+] < 135 mEq/L) hypo-osmolarity in plasma (less than 270 mOsm/L) urine hyperosmolarity. other clinical features depending on the degree of hyponatremia and to its time and rate of onset include: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and seizures.

Jaundice is characterized by an increase of bilirubin in the blood resulting in yellowish staining of the skin surface and/or mucous membranes and in particular of the sclerae, the first clinical sign of jaundice. When the disease is severe you can have an accumulation of bilirubin (a bright yellow pigment) also in internal organs. Jaundice pigmentation is caused by an increased concentration of bilirubin in the blood and the yellowish staining occurs when the concentration exceeds to 2-2.5 mg/dL. In severe conditions the level of bilirubin can reach 30/40 mg/dL. We talk about hyperbilirubinemia when the level of bilirubin is higher than 1.2 mg/dL. Every day we produce physiologically bilirubin, blood bilirubin levels in the normal adult are 0.3-1.2 mg/dL. The pathological increase in bilirubinemia (jaundice) is caused by an alteration in the metabolism of bilirubin, in its production, or in the transfer from plasma to bile,as it is produced daily being an important component of the bile. Jaundice can be caused by: - increase of unconjugated bilirubin, a non-water soluble (liposoluble) product, which cannot be excreted with urine; it can accumulate in the blood, in the skin and in the mucous membranes) increase of conjugated bilirubin (water-soluble), which can be excreted in the urine - - mixture of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin These different types of bilirubin depend on the problem that causes the disease. METABOLISM AND ELIMINATION OF BILIRUBIN Bilirubin is the end product of heme degradation that occurs daily. 85% of the bilirubin derives from the break-down of senescent red blood cells (120 days life cycle) fig.1 by the mononuclear phagocyte system, so macrophages, at the level of the spleen, liver and bone marrow. Remaining 15% is obtained from: - turnover of the hepatic heme or hemoproteins (e.g. cytochrome P450) - 1% from premature destruction of altered or defective red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow (altered erythrocytes from defects in erythropoiesis) Heme is a component of hemoglobin present in the red blood cells. Upon red blood cells degradation, Hemoglobin is degraded into globin (a protein whose AAs are reused for erythropoiesis) and Heme, in turn degraded into iron (reused for erythropoiesis) and unconjugated bilirubin. Fig.1 Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 11 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 Heme is oxidized by the heme oxygenase (an enzyme present in the mononuclear phagocytic cells) to biliverdin. Biliverdin is reduced by biliverdin reductase in unconjugated bilirubin, non water-soluble. Unconjugated bilirubin binds to serum albumin and the complex through the bloodstream can reach the liver. At the level of the liver the complex is uptaken by the hepatocytes thanks to specific cytoplasmic proteins called ligandins, (glutathione-S- transferases), that frees bilirubin eliminating albumin. Unconjugated bilirubin in the ER of the hepatocytes is conjugated with one or two molecules of glucuronic acid. This conjugation is catalyzed by the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UGT). We obtain conjugated bilirubin, a water soluble compound that can diffuse through the cytoplasm towards the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts and be excreted as bile (formed by bilirubin, cholesterol, phospholipids, electrolytes and bile salts), which is then stored into the gallbladder, and then, especially after eating, released in the intestine (small intestine, small distal intestine, colon) to emulsify lipids and help with absorption. fig.2 Remember that conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and non toxic, while unconjugated bilirubin is not water soluble. Fig.2 In the intestine, conjugated bilirubin is deconjugated by intestinal flora bacteria and degraded to colorless urobilinogen (or bilinogen). Then, after the oxidation performed by other inersital bacteria, 80-90% of urobilinogen, after oxidation by bacteria, is removed in the feces in the form of stercobilin, responsible for their brown color. Fig.3 10-20% of urobilinogen is reabsorbed through the intestinal mucus, and through the enterohepatic (portal) circulation it is returned to the liver and excreted into bile. A small amount of reabsorbed urobilinogen, responsible for the color of urine, reaches the systemic circle and is excreted in the urine in the form of urobilin. fig.3 BILE Bile is generally composed of bilirubin, cholesterol, phospholipids, electrolytes and bile salts. ⅔ of the bile consists of bile salts, formed by the conjugation of bile acids with taurine or glycine. Bile acids are the major catabolic products of cholesterol; they are water-soluble sterols with carboxylated side chains. The liver secretes from 12 to 36 gm of bile acids a day and their fecal loss is from 0.2 to 0.6 gm a day. 95% of secreted bile acids are reabsorbed from the gut lumen and recirculated to the liver (enterohepatic circulation) to maintain a large endogenous pool of bile acids for digestive and excretory purposes. Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 12 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 Bile salts are highly effective detergents: they stimulate the bile flow and the secretion of lipids (phospholipids, cholesterol) by hepatocytes into bile. Bile, thanks to the action of bile salts, has two main functions:\n\n**emulsion and absorption of dietary lipids in the gut lumen through the detergent properties (bile salts solubilize water-insoluble dietary lipids that otherwise would just be excreted)**\n\n**elimination of waste products**\nApproach to the jaundice patients Clinical features:\n\n**Urine color, thanks to the presence of urobilin**\n\n**Feces color, thanks to the presence of stercobilin**\nIn some situations the color of urine and feces can change and so they can give you some information about the type of jaundice. Presence of associated symptoms:\n\n**itch, caused by the accumulation of bile salts.**\n\n**ache**\n\n**nausea, vomiting**\nasthenia\n\n****\n\n**temperature**\nIt is also important to ask to jaundice patients some key questions\n\n**Taking toxic substances?**\n\n**Ingestion of suspect foods?**\n\n**Contact with blood or derivatives**\nHistory of cholelithiasis (gallstones)? a condition that causes a general suppression of the bile flow1\n\n****\n\n**Family history of jaundice?**\nFig.4 There are many causes of jaundice, in fig.4 are indicated the most important ones. (The professor proceeded to read the main causes listed). Q:”Why pregnancy?” A:”Pregnancy because sometimes in the last period of the gestation there could be alteration of the hepatic functions, or an increased concentration of hormones that can affect the membranes of the bile canaliculus, there is inflammation and because of it there is an obstruction in the bile flow”. Specifically, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is linked to massive destruction of RBCs, poor hepatic uptake or impaired conjugation; conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is linked to excretion problems by hepatocytes causing conjugated bilirubin to go back into the blood. In connection with the types of bilirubin that is increased in the blood (conjugated or not), we can divide the jaundice into three types:\n\n**Pre-hepatic jaundice:**the altered stage of the bilirubin metabolism is extra hepatic.\nHepatic jaundice: the alteration is intrahepatic.\n\n****\n\n**Post-hepatic jaundice**\nPRE-HEPATIC JAUNDICE This type of jaundice is caused by an hyperproduction of unconjugated bilirubin. Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 13 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 We have an increased unconjugated bilirubin in the blood that may depend on extrahepatic causes. Feces will be pleiochromic (very dark) due to an excess stercobilin and urine will be hyperchromic due to a high quantity of urobilin. Pre-hepatic jaundice may depend on:\n\n**Hemolysis:**excessive destruction of red blood cells, a condition termed hemolytic anemias. For this reason this type of disease is called hemolytic jaundice.\nThe causes can be: bacterial infection spleen hyper functionality (splenomegaly), that can cause a reduction in the half-life of the red blood cells. autoimmune diseases: in case of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a group of diseases characterized by malfunctioning of the immune system with the production of autoantibodies directed against antigens (proteins) present on red cells surface. favism or G6PD defect: genetic disease characterized by G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency which is essential for erythrocytes correct functioning and survival against oxidative damage. The intake of beans, peas, some drugs and particular substances can inhibit the G6PD enzyme and red blood cells become unable to repair oxidative damage. Favism is diffused in Sardinia, being hereditary. sickle cell anemia: hereditary malformation of hemoglobin, red blood cells have a sickle shape and for this reason they have difficulties especially circulating into the narrow vessels and they break easily hereditary spherocytosis: autosomal dominant, deficiency of specific membrane proteins of the red blood cell (spectrin, ankyrin), red blood cells shape is similar to a sphere (spherocytes) hereditary elliptocytosis: autosomal dominant, deficiency of cell membrane proteins (spectrin), red blood cells shape is elliptical As in both hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis the shape of the red blood cells is affected, we have a high level of rupture especially inside the narrow vessels, with the release of hemoglobin so high production of unconjugated bilirubin (3, 4, 5 times more than necessary).\n\n**Ineffective erythropoiesis:**occurs when we have the destruction of the defective red blood cells, possible causes:\nthalassemia or Mediterranean anemia: hereditary disease characterized by reduced or absent synthesis of hemoglobin (causing a reduced transport of oxygen) pernicious anemia: deficiency of vitamin B12, that is usually associated with reduced intestinal absorption sideroblastic anemia: deficiency of iron (reduced transport of oxygen) leukemias Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 14 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 So, these are all situations in which erythrocytes are destroyed massively with a subsequent hyperproduction of unconjugated bilirubin. A specific type of hemolytic disease is the Newborn hemolytic disease (also called erythroblastosis fetalis), it is a fetal disease that can affect the fetus of a Rh- mother and a Rh+ father, the problem occurs if the fetus is Rh+. The mother starts to produce antibodies against the Rh+ of the fetus. Concerning the first baby, these antibodies are not enough to destroy the red blood cells. The problem arises in the case of a second pregnancy if the fetus is again Rh+, because the mother has already antibodies against the red blood cells of the fetus, and this can cause a serious pathology due to the production of a great amount if unconjugated bilirubin that starts to accumulate at the level of the skin and in the base nuclei of the brain causing kernicterus, a form of psychomotor retardation. Looking at fig.5 we understand that the liver works properly: it is able to conjugate a great amount of unconjugated bilirubin, but not all of it. Part of it will Fig.5 remain in the blood and if the concentration of unconjugated bilirubin will exceed 2-2.5 mg/L, I will have jaundice. At the end we will have dense bile, very dark and very rich in bilirubin. So, after favoring the excretion of the waste products, after favoring the absorption of lipids, the conjugated bilirubin is again unconjugated; but because the quantity of conjugated bilirubin is great, there will be a great production of stercobilin eliminated with feces, that will be very dark. A portion of bilinogen is reabsorbed, it reaches the liver, part of it is reduced but a great amount of it is secreted in the urine, so I will have a great amount of urobilin rendering the urine hyperchromic too. HEPATIC JAUNDICE This kind of jaundice is caused by a reduction of liver function. Characterized by alteration of the uptake or conjugation or excretion process of bilirubin It can appear because of different liver diseases, for example: a decrease in ligandins (the proteins necessary for the uptake of the unconjugated bilirubin), a reduced activity of the UGT enzyme, liver damage for example in case of cirrhosis or hepatitis, degenerative processes like steatosis or toxic processes. All conditions that can affect the liver function can be responsible for this type of jaundice. We can distinguish three defects: A. Defect of uptake of unconjugated bilirubin, which remains in the blood (we observe in the blood Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) B. Conjugation defect of unconjugated bilirubin goes back to bloodstream (we observe in the blood Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) C. Bilirubin excretion in bile ducts defect, so that it goes in bloodstream (we will observe in the blood Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia or mixed hyperbilirubinemia Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 15 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 If there is a defect in the uptake we will have less production of bile. If I have a defect in the conjugation I will have less production of bile. If I have a defect in the excretion of bilirubin I will have less production of bile. The color of urine and feces depends on the type of bilirubin present in the blood: hyperchromic urine only with conjugated bilirubin, feces can be colorless or normal with more or less fatty stools in situations in which I produce less bile, which is not rich in conjugated bilirubin, so this bile is not dark and after being released in the intestine I will have normal or colorless stool. Cattiness of stool also depends on underproduction of bile. No steatorrhea is present (it is an extreme condition associated with post-hepatic jaundice and failure in bile excretion). Hepatocellular jaundice due to a defect of uptake of unconjugated bilirubin (We will observe in the blood Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) The liver has difficulties in the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin produced daily; causes can be different:\n\n**anatomical or functional deficiency of the ligandins, with hepatocytes unable to uptake all the unconjugated bilirubin. (ligandins retain bilirubin-albumin complex and release albumin):**This situation occurs in the neonatal physiological jaundice and in the Gilbert syndrome.\nIn the case of babies unconjugated bilirubinemia leads to a transient and mild jaundice, but sometimes the unconjugated bilirubin can accumulate in the brain causing spasticity and mental retardation, a toxic injury named kernicterus. In the case of the Gilbert syndrome unconjugated bilirubinemia leads to an innocuous and mild jaundice. hepatocellular damage upon the onset of viral hepatitis or uptake of drugs such as rifampicin and probenecid, that may interfere with the intake of unconjugated bilirubin by hepatocytes causing mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Neonatal jaundice Normally occurring in newborns (70%), as the liver in this case is not totally mature yet (it needs two more weeks to reach the total functionality). It is more pronounced in premature infants (lower hepatic clearance and greater haemocateresis). Hepatic uptake, conjugation and biliary excretion are significantly lower in the newborn than in child and adult. Ligandinds need more time to start conjugating bilirubin, as they reach the total functionality later the first two weeks of life. Hepatic UGT activity is 100 times lower than that of the adult. During pregnancy, Fetal bilirubin passes the placenta and is conjugated and excreted from the maternal liver. At birth the functional immaturity of the liver is associated with the normal haemocateresis of the newborn transient hyperbilirubinemia. The condition is just a transient jaundice, except in the case in which bilirubin starts to accumulate in the brain. This particular type of jaundice may be exacerbated by breastfeeding: in the mother's milk there are enzymes able to deconjugate the bilirubin. Affected babies are treated with phototherapy (blue light fluorescent lamp, 420-480 nm or also UV rays) as unconjugated bilirubin (a pigment) is able to absorb light generating water-soluble fragments that can be removed with urine. Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 16 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 Hepatocellular jaundice due to conjugation defect of unconjugated bilirubin (we will observe in the blood Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) Inability of the hepatocytes to conjugate bilirubin. It could be: Physiological jaundice in infants (as in newborns the liver is not totally developed): Hepatocytes are transiently incapable to conjugate the bilirubin present in the circle due to the fact that at born the liver is not totally developed (hepatic hypofunctionality). If it is excessive (pathological): serious picture of nuclear jaundice with spasticity due to the accumulation of unbound bilirubin in the base nuclei of the brain (kernicterus).\n\n**due to altered bilirubin conjugation (hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias):**\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome type I: characterized by complete absence or severe deficiency of uridine diphosphate-glucuronyl transferase (UGT), with complete inability to conjugate bilirubin. Fatal at birth. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II or Gilbert syndrome (congenital disease, hereditary autosomal dominant) in which we have a reduced UGT activity that leads to a mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It can also occur for some drugs that interfere with the conjugation process: in this case bilirubin is uptaken by the hepatocytes and the difficulty is to conjugate it, so what turns back into the circulation is the unconjugated bilirubin. Hepatocellular jaundice due to bilirubin excretion defect (we will observe in the blood Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) Hepatocytes are able to uptake and conjugate the bilirubin but then there is a defect in the excretion of the conjugated bilirubin. We can observe this defect in other two hereditary autosomal recessive syndrome: Rotor syndrome or Dubin-Johnson syndrome; it has been demonstrated that in this case there is a problem in the transport of the conjugated bilirubin from the hepatocytes into the bile duct. In Dubin-Johnson syndrome there is a deficiency in the MRP2 transport protein, necessary to transport the bilirubin from the hepatocytes to bile ducts and at the same time there is an upregulation of the MRP3 that works in the opposite way favoring the transport of the conjugated bilirubin from the hepatocytes into the blood. In this manner the conjugated bilirubin returns back into the bloodstream. Also some drugs can interfere with the secretion, also in case of hepatocellular damage and pregnancy because of the increased levels of estrogen. All conditions that reduce excretion of the bile Fig.6 Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 17 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 Here in fig.6 we can see some cases of Hereditary Hyperbilirubinemias. Jaundice with mixed defects (uptake, conjugation and secretion) We can have a mixture of both bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), and this occurs in all the situations in which I have a damage to the liver, for example in case of hepatitis, toxic damages, cancer, etc. Hepatocellular damage (acute or chronic hepatopathies): variously associated deficits in bilirubin uptake, glucuronidation or excretion by the hepatocytes. Present signs of hepatocytic damage (increased transaminases and decreased albumin in the blood). In circulation: excess of unconjugated bilirubin and the part of conjugated bilirubin that does not reach bile. In mixed hyperbilirubinemia (ex: due to hepatic cirrhosis or viral hepatitis) the hepatocytes are damaged, so the liver is not able to uptake all the bilirubin, neither to conjugate it or secrete the conjugated bilirubin. The result is a reduced production of bile, that will be not dense, dark and full of conjugated bilirubin as in the pre-hepatic jaundice; here the bile is light, reduced in quantity, and the result is a small amount of stercobilin and urobilin. The bile that is released into the colon is reduced compared to the normal production. Feces will be hypochromic (less colored: light brown) and also more fatty (but we cannot talk about steatorrhea!): producing less amount of bile, I will have a less capacity to absorb the dietary lipids. For what concerns urine there will be a small amount of urobilin. However, in this case of mixed bilirubinemia (or also in case of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia), there also will be found conjugated bilirubin as, being water soluble, it can accumulate in the skin but also in part cross the kidneys and be excreted with urine. The presence of the conjugated bilirubin makes the urine dark. This is called “Marsala” urine, because of the Sicilian dark wine of a similar color. In the case of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia or in the case of a mixed hyperbilirubinemia (where I have both types of bilirubin), the conjugated bilirubin can be excreted with the urine. Feces will be hypochromic because there is less production of bile but urine will be darker because of the presence of conjugated bilirubin. Instead, if I have defect in the uptake or in the conjugation of bilirubin, in the blood I will have only unconjugated bilirubin that cannot be present in the urine; so, feces will be lighter (because I have less production of bile), urine will have a normal color or ever lighter, as there will be only urobilin. We can also have cholestasis, so there is inhibition of bile excretions so that it remains in the intrahepatic bile duct causing bile salts to go back to systemic circulation and with bilirubin we can detect bile salts‘ which, once accumulated in the skin, are responsible for itching. Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 18 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 POST-HEPATIC JAUNDICE Jaundice caused by the impaired bile flow (stasis jaundice or cholestatic jaundice). Hepatic jaundice can also be associated with an obstruction of the bile flow that causes cholestasis, so there is a stasis of the bile in the intrahepatic bile ducts: the bile remains in the liver. Only conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This type of jaundice is characterized by an increased concentration of conjugated bilirubin in the blood and also in this case also the bile salts together with bilirubin can be present in the blood circulation causing itching. With cholestasis caused by defects in hepatocyte bile secretion, there is the accumulation of bile pigment in the hepatic parenchyma. Without cholestasis only the bilirubin, and not the other non-diffusible bile constituents such as bile salts, pass into the blood. Here I am in the stage after the conjugation of bilirubin, so I have conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The production of bile is very low, so feces will be light or acholic (because stercobilin is missing), and urine will be very dark (due to the great amount of conjugated bilirubin), again similar to the marsala wine (very dark color). I can find bile salts also in the urine because they are water soluble. This impaired flow is caused by a mechanical obstruction (fusion or compression) of bile excretion through intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. Causes of intrahepatic cholestasis can biliary cirrhosis or malformations of the biliary tract, in turn due to viral, bacterial, neoplastic or toxic factors or also some drugs, for example the hepatic cholestasis can also be caused by an increased concentration of estrogen due to the oral contraceptives, testosteron, estrogen. Fig.7 Fig.7 Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 19 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 Extrahepatic cholestasis can be due to the presence of gallstones (made of cholesterol and calcium salts), biliary tract tumors, pancreatic tumors, all responsible for the occlusion of the extrahepatic bile ducts. Other conditions can be chronic inflammatory processes of the biliary tract, wedging of a calculus in the hepatic duct or in the common bile duct, liver or pancreatic tumors, lymphopathies of the hepatic hilum, chronic sclerosing pancreatitis, etc. All situations responsible for compression and occlusion of the bile tract. The daily production of bilirubin will reach the liver, able to uptake and to conjugate it forming the bile. The problem is its excretion because there is a stasis of the bile flow. The result is a very small amount of bile, and consequently a small production of stercobilin (feces are acholic and fatty because of the impossibility to absorb lipids; I will not have the production of bilinogen, so in the urine mostly I will have only conjugated bilirubin and biliary salts because this goes back in the blood circulation. Most of them will accumulate in the skin, a part of them can be excreted because it is water soluble, so they can cross the kidney. So to sum up: in pre-hepatic I will have very dark feces and dark urine due to only bilinogen, in hepatic i will have poorly colored and a bit fatty stool with urobilin and conjugated bilirubin in urine, in post-hepatic, light and very fatty feces (steatorrhea) and urine with conjugated bilirubin and bile salts. CHOLESTASIS Caused by an impaired bile flow because of the occlusion of either the intra or extrahepatic bile ducts fig.8&9. All the products of the bile remain in the hepatocytes so biliary pigments can be observed inside them; the detergent properties of the bile acids can be toxic for the cells causing apoptosis. Biliary pigment can also be observed inside Kupffer cells (macrophages). Other clinical symptoms are: - itching, because of the accumulation of biliary salts in the skin xanthomas, accumulation of cholesterol (a component of the bile) caused by hyperlipidemia but also - by an altered cholesterol excretion - deficiency in liposoluble substances (ex: ADEK vitamins), because of the reduced absorption of lipids from the intestine - bile canaliculi appear dilated because of the stasis of the bile Fig.8 Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 20 L1-01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 Fig 9 MECHANISM OF CHOLESTASIS Three mechanism have been proposed to explain cholestasis:\n\n**Damage of the canalicular plasma membranes:**the secretion is controlled by ATPase Na/K pump on the canalicular membrane; in some particular situations (drugs, toxic compounds..) there could be an inhibition of this pump, causing a reduction in the bile flow.\n\n**Alteration of the contractile properties of the canaliculus:**the hepatocytes have a peristaltic activity that can favor the excretion of bile, but there are some substances that can inhibit the contraction of the pericanalicular microfilaments causing cholestasis.\n\n**Alteration of canalicular membrane permeability:**for example in case of pregnancy, the increased concentration of estrogen can increase the membrane permeability of the biliary canaliculi favoring the retro-diffusion of the bile components, causing cholestasis.\nINTRA HEPATIC PREGNANCY CHOLESTASIS It is a rare condition that can affect women during the last months of gestation. It is a transient pathology that disappears after the delivery. Main symptom is itching. Most of the time it is associated with premature birth, fetal distress and placental insufficiency. The estrogens can alter the permeability of the canaliculi’s membrane being responsible for the inflammation of the biliary canaliculi, causing a reduction in the bile flow. NEONATAL CHOLESTASIS It is a consequence of a prolonged hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. The newborn needs 2 weeks more to have a to reach the total maturity and the efficiency of the liver. If the baby still has jaundice after these 2 weeks, there is a high risk of developing cholestasis. There are many causes of cholestasis. In Fig 10 there is a list (not explained). cholangiopathies: genetic and acquired biliary disorders Causes: cholangiocyte is damaged by cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia, fibropolycystic Fig.10 Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 21 01.03.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.01 diseases,disordered immunity (primarily biliary cirrhosis..), infectious agents (cytomegalovirus, bacteria...), ischemia, and toxic compounds (drugs, toxins..) primary biliary atresia: complete/partial obstruction of the lumen of the extrahepatic biliary tree within the first 3 months of life (1/3 infants with neonatal cholestasis). Causes: aberrant intrauterine development of extrahepatic biliary tree; perinatal form of biliary atresia due to the destruction of the normal biliary tree development following birth (viral infection – rotavirus, reovirus, cytomegalovirus-, auto-immune reactions); organ malformation (genetic basis) various disorders causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia referred to neonatal hepatitis And here Fig 11 is a summary of the causes of jaundice: Fig.11 Giulia Zavaroni, Elena Ravizza 22", "input": "", "output": "**definition of jaundice**\nIncreased concentration of bilirubin in the blood resulting in a yellowish staining of the skin surface and/or visible mucous membranes or sclerae.

Amyloidosis is related to the extracellular accumulation of amyloid, a deposit of fibrillary proteins. As a consequence of the deposition of these fibrillar proteins (misfolded proteins) in the extracellular tissues, the organs of the tissues involved will be compromised both from a morphological and functional point of view. This is a dynamic process, there are some abnormal proteins that are produced. Due to some mechanisms they can not be removed, so they start to aggregate forming misfolded proteins, with a β-sheet conformation, therefore the enzymes in the tissues cannot digest them. At least 23 different proteins have been identified. They are insoluble (so they cannot be degraded thanks to the action of specific enzymes), toxic (as they aggregate forming some deposits) to find a funny configuration, in the form of skeins of β-sheet fibrillary proteins. We can distinguish two types of amyloid depositions: 1.Systemic or generalised amyloidosis: Deposits are in various organs which are compromised from a morphological and functional point of view 2.Localised amyloidosis: Deposits only at the level of a specific organ, e.g. the brain or the heart. Amyloidosis can also be: 1.Primary -> idiopathic deposition of misfolded proteins 2.Secondary -> deposition of abnormal proteins is associated to other pathological conditions Amyloids are present in the extracellular space of various tissues and organs. It is observable in the organs of mesodermal origins but also in the parenchyma. So most of the target organs/tissues are peripheral nerves, skin, tongue, joints, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, some glands (adrenal, pituitary, …), lymph nodes, thyroid, etc. Amyloidosis affects the parenchymatous organs more frequently, where there is a chronic inflammation with some acute events. E.g. in case of tuberculosis, solid tumours, rheumatoid arthritis, osteomyelitis. We can have deposition of amyloids also in the vessel walls and in other interstitial compartments. These accumulations are very dangerous as they compromise both morphological and functional points of view. They can compress the tissue and organ, compromising the blood vessels and causing a reduction in the distribution of the blood in the organs. Because of the altered exchanges between blood and tissues, the final result is that the cell starts to suffer and die causing atrophy of the tissue. Amyloid deposits were identified by Virchow in 1854. He discovered that these deposits had the property to react with iodine with a similar reaction of the starch. To recognize the starch we use an iodine solution but Virchow discovered that these misfolded proteins can react with the same iodine solution, for that reason he called them amyloid deposits, although these proteins have nothing to do with starch. Later on other techniques were used to study amyloid deposits. E.g. With H&E and the light microscope, it was possible to observe that these extracellular deposits consist of an amorphous, homogeneous, eosinophilic, and hyaline extracellular substance. Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 90 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 Thanks to electron microscope they discovered that amyloids consist of continuous non-branching fibrils. Moreover with X-ray crystallography and infrared spectroscopy they found out that these proteins are arranged according to an extremely stable cross-β-pleated sheet conformation. With another technique it has been observed that in these fibres there are selective points where the Congo red staining can bind to these fibrils. So it was possible to observe how amyloid deposits are not only composed of amorphous materials but also by fibrillar material, not a homogeneous material. Here you can see the sites where the Congo red stain can bind (fig.1). fig.1 FIBRILS: Each fibre of amyloid is composed of 4 - 6 fibrils. fibrils are without branches, and have a diameter of 7.5-10 nm. Why can't these deposits of amyloid be removed? Because with these specific conformations, they cannot be attacked by the normal enzymes. So these proteins are going to form deposits in the parenchyma causing different damages in the tissue or in the organ. So there is a failure of the organ at the end. fig.2 These fibrils wound around one another to form the amyloid fiber that forms the β-sheet conformation. Each fibril has variable length, it is rigid, non-branched and has a diameter of 7.5-10 nm. For example, with the electron microscope you can observe how these Q: What is the origin of these proteins? A: They are normal proteins that start to aggregate and accumulate in an excessive way and cannot be removed by the normal system (macrophages, ubiquitin proteasome system…). Q: Which is the specific protein in the original form? A: There are different proteins that can fold in that improper way, there is not a specific protein. Q: Are prions involved in this process? A: Yes Q: What is the difference between prions and amyloids? A: Amyloid is a common way to identify any kind of misfolded proteins with these β-sheet conformation, that are insoluble and cannot be attacked/destroyed by enzymes. Independently of their origin they all react with the iodine solution, as well as it occurs when I want to recognize the starch or amylose. That’s why it is called amyloid. But it has nothing to do with the amylose. STRUCTURE OF THE AMYLOID FIBRE Concerning the structure of the amyloid fiber, it is formed in 95% of non-branched and rigid fibrils, but 5% is a globular lipoprotein plus some glycosaminoglycans. This globular glycoprotein is also called AP - amyloid P Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 91 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 component. AP, together with the glycosaminoglycans, binds to the fibrils. Amyloid P component (AP) is a globular glycoprotein: - belongs to the class of pentrassins (pentameric proteins consisting of 5 identical monomer subunits associated with Ca2+ which bind to each other to form a pentagonal structure) - It has a pentagonal shape - It binds to fibroids in a calcium-dependent way - AP has a blood precursor (SAP - serum AP) which is free in the serum Amyloidosis is a group of diseases that results from abnormal folding of proteins which are insoluble, aggregate, and form deposits as fibrils in extracellular tissues. Normally we have some mechanisms to degrade them: misfolded proteins are degraded intracellularly in proteasomes or extracellularly by macrophages. In amyloidosis these mechanisms fail, so they are not able to completely remove these deposits, which start accumulating a misfolded protein outside the cells. We can observe two general categories of proteins: - Normal proteins that have an inherent tendency to fold improperly, associate and form fibrils when they are produced in increased amounts; therefore, when normal proteins are secreted in abnormal amounts. Mutant proteins that are prone to misfolding and subsequent aggregation. FORMATION OF A B SHEET STRUCTURE (fig.3) We can have the formation of these deposits as a consequence of increased production of normal proteins, as in the case of increased proliferation of plasma cells. We can also have an increased production of proteins associated with diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, where we have an increased production of inflammatory mediators. Or we can have the production of a normal quantity of proteins but the proteins are mutated because of some genetic problems. fig.3 Q: When we mentioned liver fibrosis, did we mean this? Is this what we talked about when talking about cirrhosis? A: We can have some areas of cirrhosis characterised by amyloidosis because in case of cirrhosis we have a chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Fibrosis is when you have a deposition of fibrotic tissue because of an Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 92 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 increased production of extracellular matrix components such as collagen fibers, but we can also have amyloid deposits. Q: What is the AL protein? A: AL stands for Amyloid Light chain. Because this kind of amyloidosis is caused by an accumulation in case of monoclonal proliferation. We have proliferation of plasma cells with the production of lambda and k light chains. CLASSIFICATIONS: Systemic (generalised) amyloidosis in which many organs may be involved. We can have two subclasses: - Primary are associated with plasma cells disorders - Secondary to other pathological conditions characterized by chronic inflammation Localised amyloidosis, when deposits are limited to a single organ, such as the heart or the brain. SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSES (fig. 4) Four classes of systemic amyloidosis have been described. a.Reactive amyloidosis b.Amyloidosis associated with immunocytes disorders c.Amyloidosis associated with familiar defects d.Amyloidosis associated with hemodialysis fig.4 A)REACTIVE SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS (AA FIBRILS)– SECONDARY AMYLOIDOSIS It is linked to other diseases associated (secondary) to chronic inflammation and tissue necrosis: Tuberculosis, chronic osteomyelitis, bronchiectasis, pressure (decubitus) ulcers, infected burns, rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue disorders (ankylosing spondylitis), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 93 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 disease and ulcerative colitis), solid tumours (renal cell carcinoma, mesotheliomas, Hodgkin lymphoma), etc. During these diseases there is a high synthesis of cytokines that are produced by the inflammatory process. These products stimulate the liver to produce the precursor, SAA (serum amyloid, acute phase) protein. In fact during chronic inflammation we have an increased production of the acute phase proteins. These precursors are normally degraded by monocyte-derived enzymes (mainly metalloproteinase - MMPs), but if the action of the enzyme fails, the enzymes are not able to degrade the precursors. The results are incomplete breakdown of SAA insoluble AA molecules and genetic structural abnormality of SAA resistant to degradation by macrophages. To recognize these amyloidoses I can perform a histological diagnosis with anti-AA antibodies. You will see that in all the amyloidosis you will have the involvement mainly of kidney, liver and spleen. Q: Is the non-soluble AA the SAA? A: No, the SAA is the normal protein produced by the liver. These normal proteins if they are produced in excess they are degraded by some enzymes. If the enzymes do not work, the result is the formation of insoluble peptides (insoluble AA). Q: What is the function of SAA? A: SAA is an acute phase protein, which has the function to increase the inflammatory response. Some acute phase proteins are albumin, fibrinogens, reactive protein C. The amount of these proteins increase when there is an inflammatory process. B)IMMUNOCYTE DISORDERS WITH AMYLOIDOSIS (AL FIBRILS)–SYSTEMIC AND PRIMARY AMYLOIDOSIS Systemic because it can involve various organs, but is primary because it is not associated with other pathological conditions as the first form that we have seen. Caused by exaggerated monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells. We can observe this kind of amyloidosis in: - 10-15% of multiple myeloma cases (degradation of the bone tissue caused by the osteoclasts. This patient have fragile bones which may break) - 20-25% of light chain disease cases - Some neoplastic and non-neoplastic proliferative processes of plasma cells and B lymphocytes The protein, which is prone to fold in the improper way, is the AL fibril protein (A: amyloid; L: light chains). These protein constituents are: free and unpaired k or lambda light chains or their fragments (referred to as Bence-Jones protein); - L-lambda are present 2-3 times more than L-k. These light chains are synthesized by the leukocytes. These diseases are caused by an excessive proliferation of immunocytes → A great proliferation of cells is a great production of light chains. Free light chains are present in the serum, urine and are also deposited in tissues as amyloid. Not all the free light chains can accumulate and aggregate forming the final amyloid deposits; only some of them have an amino acid sequence compatible with B-fibrillar configuration. That depends on the sequences of AAs. Only the lambda light chains have a specific sequence of AAs. Organs involved are heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, etc. C)HEREDOFAMILIAL AMYLOIDOSIS (AA,ATTR FIBRILS)–SYSTEMIC AND PRIMARY AMYLOIDOSIS In this case the quantity of the protein is normal, but the protein is a mutant one. We can have two types: 1. Non-neuropathic Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 94 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 We can see this disease in familial Mediterranean fever (autosomal recessive). It is an auto inflammatory syndrome characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells that are not able to function properly (hereditary defects of PMN function). There is an excessive production of IL-1, which can stimulate the liver to produce a high quantity of acute phase proteins. There are also attacks of fever associated with inflammation of serosal surfaces (peritoneum, pleura, synovial membrane). The precursor that is produced is the SAA protein, serum amyloid acute phase protein, which will not be degraded properly, and so starts to accumulate. AA fibril protein (A: amyloid; A: acute phase) derives from the proteolytic degradation of SAA. 2. Neuropathic This type is associated with pathologies that affect the nerves, as Familial disorders such as polyneuropathies (e.g. familial amyloidotic polyneuropathies or FAP), cardiomyopathy, kidney disease (autosomal dominant). The misfolded proteins are indicated as ATTR fibril protein (A: amyloid, TTR: transthyretin), besides normal protein there are fragments of mutant TTR. The genetic defects of protein synthesis are due to a mutant transthyretin (TTR). The most common defect is the replacement of single valine with methionine at position 30. TTR does not increase in blood but it is deposited as amyloid fibrils in the connective tissue because genetically determined alterations of structure promote TTR misfolding and aggregation. The organs involved are mainly kidneys and thyroid. In familial Mediterranean fever the organs involved are kidneys, blood vessels, spleen, respiratory tract. In case of FAP the deposition of amyloid is in peripheral and autonomic nerves. D)HEMODIALYSIS-ASSOCIATED AMYLOIDOSIS (AH FIBRILS)– SYSTEMIC AND SECONDARY AMYLOIDOSIS The main patients affected are on long-term hemodialysis for renal failure, after 7-10 years of hemodialysis. These deposits are present in the carpal ligament of the wrist resulting in compression of the median nerve, so these pathologies that cause it are called bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, with cystic bone lesions and amyloid deposition in the synovium and bones. The misfolded protein involved is the AH fibril protein (A: amyloid; H: hemodialysis) or AB2m, while the protein component is B2-microglobulin; it is present in high concentrations in the serum of persons with renal dysfunction (it cannot be filtered through dialysis membranes). These proteins can bind to collagen and settle in the connective. They are synthesized in the liver. The target organs are skeletal and muscular systems. Q: What is hemodialysis? A: It is a mechanism to eliminate the toxic compound (e.g. bilirubin) to the blood. It is an artificial substitution to the kidneys that do not function properly. LOCALISED FORMS OF AMYLOIDOSIS Localised deposition of amyloid in a single organ or tissue, mainly veins and heart, (no involvement of other sites in the body). The deposits may produce detectable nodular masses or be evident only on microscopic examination. A)AMYLOID OF AGEING (AS FIBRILS)– LOCALISED SENIL AMYLOIDOSIS Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 95 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 Linked to older patients, they are responsible for serious degenerative CNS disorders: - Alzheimer's disease: The precursor is indicated as APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein). We have a proteolysis of this protein that can happen in two ways, leading to: 1.A non amyloidogenic pathway: In this case, two enzymes are involved (alpha and gamma secretase). These enzymes are able to degrade the ATP in soluble fragments. 2.An amyloidogenic pathway: In this case, instead of the alpha secretase, we have the involvement of beta secretase. If the beta secretase plus the gamma secretase try to cut these proteins, the result is the formation of some soluble fragments plus an insoluble fragment that is the amyloid beta. This insoluble portion of the ATP can be composed of 40,41,42 or 43 amino acids. The most toxic type is composed of 42 amino acids. AS fibril protein: (A: amyloid; S: senile) - Prion encephalopathy (Gertsmann-Straussler-Sheinker or GSS): caused by the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins indicated as PrPc. This is responsible for severe damages in the central nervous system. This disease is fatal in a short time. Senile cardiac amyloidosis (increased levels of normal TTR): the excessive protein is normal but it is not eliminated so it starts to aggregate forming the deposits. The target organs are brain and heart Q: What are the possible symptoms of a possible amyloidosis on the heart? A: The deposits start at the level of the endocardium but could get to the myocardium causing atrophy of the cells due to the pressure which is applied on them. The myocardium will lose its functions. These deposits could also appear in the valves of the heart, so finally there is a severe failure of the heart because it will be compromised from a functional point of view. B)ENDOCRINE AMYLOID (AE FIBRILS)- LOCALISED AMYLOIDOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH METABOLIC DISORDERS OR TUMOURS OF ENDOCRINE GLANDS It may be involved in: - Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland; - Islet tumours of the pancreas, - Islet of Langerhans in type II diabetes mellitus, etc. The misfolded protein is the AE fibril protein (A: amyloid, E: endocrine) Protein component (locally produced peptides): - Precursor of calcitonin; - Precursor of amylin (IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide) produced by the B cells of the pancreas. There are depositions of B-fibrils for anomalies of precursor metabolism in case of mutated precursors or in normal proteins in excess, or altered local conditions. The target organs are the endocrine glands. TO SUMMARIZE: Fig.5 gives the classification of amyloidosis. Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 96 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 fig.5 Q: How is it possible to accumulate only light chains? Aren’t light chains always bound to heavy chains? A: This is true for example for antibodies, but some types of amyloidosis are characterized by an increased proliferation of specific proteins. In this case we have diseases associated with increased proliferation of plasma cells, lymphocytes (multiple myeloma) etc. Normally we already have a higher production of light chains compared to heavy chains and when there is an overproduction of proteins (or mutated/abnormal) there are systems able to get rid of these proteins such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These pathways are important to eliminate excessive amounts of specific proteins or “wrong” proteins. The primary amyloidosis instead ischaracterized by the extra production of light chains (not all bound to the heavy chains) that aggregate and deposit in pairs or fragments because the light chains have abnormalities in the sequences of the amino acids. Q: Can you explain hemodialysis? A: Hemodialysis is a technique to remove from the blood all the wastes: metabolites and in general compounds that have to be eliminated. Usually, this function is exerted by the kidnes: they purify and clean the blood through filtration in order to eliminate all the substances with urine. If the kidneys do not work properly the toxic compounds (urea, ammonia…) cannot be eliminated from the blood, that’s why we use an external mechanism to purify it: hemodialysis. It’s important to purify the blood especially when the function of the kidneys is at 15-20%. Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani fig.6 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 Methodology → The doctor inserts an access in the blood vessel of the patient (usually in the arm), the blood goes outside of the body and is filtered outside of the body by a particular machine called dialyzer (or artificial kidney). Once the blood is filtered it is inserted back into the vessels of the patient. All the proteins and cells of the blood are not lost obviously but only the toxic compounds that have a diameter small enough to be filtered. Q: Is it possible to have hypotension related to amyloidosis? A: The presence of deposits in the walls of vessels is responsible for the reduction of diameter of the lumen and thus can provoke alterations of the blood circulation (vasoconstriction). If these deposits affect the heart it’s possible to have hypotension. To keep the blood pressure at physiological values all the systems have to work properly: the cardiac output, the volume and peripheral resistance. If the heart is not able to work properly due to the deposits of amyloids this will cause atrophy of the myocardium and consequently the heart failure. In this case the patient can have hypotension because it is not possible to keep pressure at high levels. Another example is if the deposits of amyloids are in the kidneys. In this case it’s also possible to have hypotension because kidneys are important organs to control the blood pressure due to renin-angiotensin and aldosterone system. CLINICAL MANIFESTATION Clinical manifestation of amyloidosis depends on the severity of the accumulation of the deposits of amyloids and on the importance of the organ. We can have two situations: 1.Amyloidosis with unexpected anatomic (conformation) change without clinical manifestations; 2.Amyloidosis with serious clinical problems and even death; At the beginning the clinical manifestations are not specific. Subjects accuse weakness, weight loss, light-headedness, syncope, confusion, …, so they have general problems. Later, when the amounts of the deposits are increased we have the onset of some specific clinical manifestations: with renal, cardiac, GI tract involvement, and failure of the organs. This kind of disease is considered progressive. Many organs are involved. In the case of systemic amyloidosis in fact the disease is fatal. The prognosis for the patients is usually poor. The patients usually die. The main organs involved in amyloidosis are: KIDNEYS At the beginning they can have normal size, shape and color but later on due to the increased deposition of amyloids in the vascular walls, the kidneys can become severely compromised with the reduction of the diameter of the arterioles, the involvement of the glomerulus and then interstitial peritubular tissues. At the beginning the patient will have a mild proteinuria, then with the progression of the disease a severe impairment of the kidneys resulting in an irreversible damage characterized by an irreversible uremia, then the renal failure that can lead to death. The only solutions to contrast the insufficiency of the kidney are hemodialysis or transplantation. It is very dangerous to keep all the toxic substances in our body (for example if ammonia accumulates it can reach the Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 98 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 brain and cause severe neurological problems such as encephalopathies). In fig.7 you can see the accumulation of amyloids in the glomeruli (dark areas) and it’s also possible to see how the architecture of the glomerulus is destroyed. This will compromise in a progressive way the function of the kidneys: it’s impossible for them to remove toxic compounds from our blood. fig.7 LIVER At the beginning the accumulation of amyloids causes a mild enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly). With the progression of the disease the enlargement becomes more marked causing a severe hepatomegaly. At the beginning amyloids start to accumulate in the Disse space and with the progression of the disease in the hepatocytes and in the sinusoids. The presence of these deposits disturb all the exchanges between the circulation and the tissue and can also press the tissue causing death of cells and finally atrophy of the organ. The hepatic vasculature can be affected too and deposits can be present in the vascular walls causing narrowing of vessels; every time that there is an obstruction or a narrowing of the hepatic vessels this cause the increase of pressure at the level of the portal vein (portal hypertension) with all its complications (e.g. ascites). The prognosis in this case is quite severe, because the liver is highly compromised by the presence of the deposits. fig.8 Infig.8is possible to see the same slide of the liver stained with different stains: - left → stained with Congo red. Reveals pink-red deposits of amyloid in the walls of blood vessels and along sinusoids. right → yellow-green birefringence of the deposits. HEART It can be affected by both systemic and local amyloidosis. The deposits start to appear at the level of the endocardium, later in the myocardium and then in the pericardium. When the deposits start to accumulate in the myocardium the situation becomes very dangerous because they cross the myocardial fibers causing the death of the fibers (atrophy) and a reduced functionality of the myocardium. It may also involve valves. The consequences are the atrophy of the myocardial wall with a consequent hypomotility, often atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction are damaged that will lead to heart failure with cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias (fatal). Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 99 16.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.8 ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Amyloidosis can affect several glands, for example pancreas, thyroids, adrenal glands and pituitary gland. It does not give significant clinical manifestations. SPLEEN Slowly it’s possible to observe a marked splenomegaly (also the activity of the spleen is increased and this will affect the life of the RBCs causing for example anemia). At the beginning the amyloids form the so-called “tapioca-like granules” that are separate accumulation of amyloids. With the progression of the disease these granules fuse together forming a single area occupied by amyloids called “lardaceous spleen” SKIN Involved mainly in AL amyloidosis (55%) or AA amyloidosis (42%). In this case it’s possible to observe papules, slightly raised plaques with a waxy appearance mainly in the axillary region, in the anal or inguinal region, on the face, on the neck, and on mucous membranes (ear, tongue). It’s also possible to observe purpura and microhemorrhages. GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT The patient experiences more clinical symptoms like obstructions, disturbances in digestion, ulcerations, malabsorption, hemorrhages, diarrhea and the enlargement of the tongue (macroglossia). The areas involved in these depositions are the esophagus, the stomach and the large intestine. NERVOUS SYSTEM Familial amyloidosis neuropathies (CNS) and the AL amyloidosis. The deposits can accumulate in CNS and PNS compromising their function. For example the carpal tunnel syndrome (accumulation of amyloids in the nerve of the wrist) and Alzheimer's disease (accumulation in the brain of misfolded proteins). We can also have problems with increased blood pressure, sphincter incontinence, etc. JOINTS Deformation of the joints that lead to arthritis but also the synovial membrane, synovial fluid and articular cartilage can be compromised. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and all the respiratory organs can be affected by the deposition of amyloids. Here the amyloid aggregates cause the blockage of the ducts and so the air passage. TREATMENT There are few ongoing trials that try to treat amyloidosis avoiding the deposition of amyloids in the organs. New drugs studied use different techniques:\n\n**help the elimination of misfolded proteins**\n\n**correct protein misfolding**\n\n**inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils**\n\n**modify/cancel its extracellular deposition**\n\n**stimulate lysis and mobilization of fibrils**\nThese are clinical trials, at the moment there isn’t a specific and functional treatment for this disease. Eleonora Deinite, Daria Ghasriani 100", "input": "", "output": "**what is amyloidosis?**\nAmyloidosis is a condition associated with a number of inherited and inflammatory disorders in which there’s accumulation of fibrillar proteins (amyloid) in the extracellular space that damages surrounding tissues. It is not a single disease but rather, there’s a group of diseases characterized by amyloid deposit. The abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of misfolded proteins which then organize into beta-pleated sheets, that are insoluble. These protein aggregates bind glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans which under the microscope, when stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain, gives them the appearance of starch: eosinophilic, amorphous, hyaline-like. Hence, the name “amyloid”. Amyloid deposits were identified by Virchow in 1854. He discovered that these deposits had the property to react with iodine with a similar reaction of the starch. To recognize the starch we use an iodine solution but Virchow discovered that these misfolded proteins can react with the same iodine solution, for that reason he called them amyloid deposits. Although these proteins have nothing to do with starch. Two general categories of proteins that form amyloid: normal proteins produced in enormous amounts, and a small fraction of them fold incorrectly. abnormal proteins with incorrect amino acid sequences are produced in normal amounts, and they fold incorrectly\n\n**About 23 different proteins can form amyloids.**\nThese accumulations are very dangerous as they compromise both morphological and functional points of view. They can compress the tissue and organ, compromising the blood vessels and causing a reduction in the distribution of the blood in the organs. The final result is that the cell starts to suffer and die causing atrophy of the tissue.\n\n**what types of amyloidosis are there?**\nWe can distinguish two types of amyloid depositions: 1. Systemic amyloidosis: Deposits are in various organs which are compromised from a morphological and functional point of view primary systemic amyloidosis: associated with B cell disorders: AL AMYLOIDOSIS secondary systemic amyloidosis: underlying chronic inflammatory process AA AMYLOIDOSIS AH (Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis) 2. Localized amyloidosis: Deposits only at the level of a specific organ Primary ****(idiopathic) Secondary ****to other pathological conditions Hereditary or familial amyloidosis constitute a separate, 3. although heterogeneous group, with several distinctive patterns of organ involvement.\n\n**describe the chemical and physical composition of amyloid**\nThe fibrils are rigid, unbranched, variable length, diameter about 10 nm 4-6 fibrils joined together by hydrogen bonds form an amyloid fiber with an unusual β-sheet conformation that makes them unaffected by tissue enzymes 95% of amyloid is protein, 5% are glycoprotein (called amyloid P component) and glycosaminoglycans. Amyloid p component is a pentameric glycoprotein of the pentrassins class that binds to fibrils with a calcium-dependent mechanism\n\n**where in the body is amyloid deposited?**\nAmyloids are present in the extracellular space of various tissues and organs. Preferential deposition of amyloid: vessel wall and interstitial compartment Commonly affected organs: peripheral nerves skin tongue joints heart liver spleen kidneys adrenal lymph nodes thyroid\n\n**Organs affected by chronic inflammatory diseases or tissue**\nnecrosis are more at risk\n\n**Describe the pathogenesis of the systemic forms of amyloidosis SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS:**\n1. AL amyloidosis, (primary): “L”: In B cell disorders, like multiple myeloma, plasma cells in the bone marrow produce more light chains than heavy chains, and those excess light chains leak out into the blood. Since there are so many light chains, some (the ones with a.a compatible with beta configuration) misfold into AL proteins, and build up in various tissues (heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, etc.) 2. AA amyloidosis, or secondary: the misfolded protein comes from serum amyloid A, an acute phase reactant (secreted by the liver when there’s inflammation). In chronic inflammation, like in rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, cancer, there’s lots of serum amyloid A in the blood. A small portion spontaneously misfold into AA amyloids, which accumulate in tissues→ amyloidosis. MMPs (monocyte-derived) are important for SAA degradation, if enzyme defect or insufficient →incomplete breakdown of SAA.Histological diagnosis with anti-AA antibodies. Targets: mainly kidneys, liver and spleen 3. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis (AH), secondary: after years of hemodialysis patients may develop bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (deposition of amyloid in the carpal ligament → compression of the median nerve), and cystic bone lesions (amyloid deposition in the bone). AH fibril protein is a ****beta-2- microglobulin, that accumulates in the blood with renal dysfunction (not filtered by dialysis). It binds to collagen and settles in the connective tissue. Targets: skeletal and muscular system. 4. Familial amyloidosis (primary) 1. Familial amyloidotic Polyneuropathies (FAP) autosomal dominant. ****Genetic defects of protein synthesis: mutant transthyretin (TTR) → prone to misfolding → ATTR (amyloid transthyretin) • Target: kidneys, thyroid, and peripheral and autonomic nerves. 2. Familial Mediterranean fever: autosomal recessive defects of neutrophil function: excessive IL-1 production that cause attacks of fever, associated with inflammation of serosal surfaces (peritoneum, pleura, synovial membrane) and cause abdominal pain, arthritis. There’s an accumulation of AA fibril. Targets: kidneys, blood vessels, spleen, respiratory tract.\n\n**Describe the pathogenesis of the localized forms of amyloidosis**\nAmyloid of aging (AS fibrils): localized amyloid deposition in older populations. The target organs are brain and heart Alzheimer's disease: APP Prion encephalopathy: accumulation of abnormal prion proteins indicated as PrPc. This is responsible for severe damages in the central nervous system. This disease is fatal in a short time. Senile cardiac amyloidosis : increased levels of normal, non mutated, transthyretin (TTR) Endocrine amyloid (AE fibrils): localized amyloid deposition associated with metabolic disorders or tumors of endocrine glands. It may be found in: Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland Islet tumors of the pancreas Islet of Langerhans in type II diabetes mellitus, etc. Protein component: locally produced peptides: precursor of calcitonin, precursor of amylin (IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide) produced by the beta cells of the pancreas\n\n**summary table with classification of amyloidosis**\n\n****\n\n**What are the clinical manifestations of amyloidosis?**\nIt is possible to have amyloidosis that does not cause clinical manifestations and at the same time, some cases of amyloidosis cause serious clinical problems and even death. The clinical manifestations are rather unspecific, especially in the beginning, there may be weakness, weight loss, light-headedness, syncope, etc. It all depends on which type of amyloidosis it is and thus, which organ/s it affects. With progression of the condition we might start seeing other signs that are more specific and useful for the diagnosis such as problems with the kidneys, heart, GI tract. In general, prognosis is very poor with systemic amyloidosis. Kidney manifestations (timeline): normal size and color → may progress to atrophy due to ischemia of renal arteries caused by amyloid deposition in arterial wall early glomerular dysfunction (its architecture is obliterated by the massive accumulation of amyloid) later issues in the tubules (peritubular space) and arterioles signs: from modest proteinuria to nephrotic syndrome progressive uremia (high levels of urea in the blood) →kidney failure → death therapy: dialysis and transplant Liver Initial deposition in the perisinusoidal space and progressive growth that causes deformity, pressure atrophy → replacement of large areas of liver parenchyma. deposits of amyloid in the walls of sinusoids and in Kupffer cells hepatomegaly, portal hypertension, diminished liver function average survival with liver amyloidosis is 9 months. Heart initial deposits between muscle fibers in the myocardium → progressive expansion → thickening and stiffening of ventricular wall, as well as damage to the conduction system → hypomobility it may involve valves and pericardium heart may appear firm and enlarged cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy and arrythmias → heart failure Endocrine system: no significant clinical manifestations. Spleen: deposition may be limited to the follicles (tapioca-like granules) or it may involve the walls of the sinuses and connective tissue framework in the red pulp→ splenomegaly. Fusion of deposits → lardaceous spleen. Skin: involved mainly in AL amyloidosis (55%) or AA amyloidosis (42%). Papules in the axilla, inguinal region, face, neck, and on mucous membranes. small hemorrhages and purpura. GI tract: Obstructions, disturbances in digestion, ulcerations, malabsorption, hemorrhages, diarrhea. Nodular depositions in the tongue may cause macroglossia. (AL both primary and associated with myeloma) Nervous system: neuropathies, alzheimer, carpal tunnel syndrome, etc. Joints: Deformation of joints and synovial membrane that lead to arthritis Respiratory tract: may be involved locally or diffusely.\n\n**is there a treatment for amyloidosis?**\nOngoing clinical trials with new drugs to: decrease the chronic antigenic stimulus that produces amyloid correct protein misfolding inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils modify/eliminate its extra-cellular deposition stimulate lysis and mobilization of fibrils"}

Fig.1 presents a table describing the adult reference range of leukocytes in adults (leukocytes formula): - Neutrophils - 60% of total leukocytes, most abundant. Neutrophils are the main player in acute inflammation. Lymphocytes - 31% - Monocytes - 5% - Eosinophils - 3,5%. Basophils - 0,5% Fig.1 In fig.2 you can find the normal adult reference ranges concerning red blood cells (to be known if examining anaemic patient): - Haemoglobin is a globular protein responsible for O2 transport in RBCs, its concentration is measured in g/dL. Generally: 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women, under these values the patient is anaemic. - Hematocrit is the volume occupied by RBCs, it is expressed in %. Generally: 44% in men and 38% in women. - MCV - mean cell volume– it expresses the average cell volume of red blood cells; it is expressed in femtoliters (fL). To calculate it, the hematocrit has to be divided for the number of RBCs, which ranges around ~80 fL. Hematocrit/n° red cells. This value is really important because some anemias are characterised by an abnormal MCV. MCH - mean cell haemoglobin - concentration of Hb in one RBC, expressed in picograms [Hb]/n° red cells. - MCHC - mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration - refers to the average concentration of Hb in a given volume of cells, expressed in g/100mL. Fig.2 Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 1 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 HEMATOPOIESIS It concerns the process, which takes place in the bone marrow(fig.3), consisting in the formation, proliferation and differentiation of new blood cells, deriving from the same initial progenitor, which is a pluripotent stem cell (total stem cell- HSC) (progenitor cells are mainly multipotent cells that can differentiate into many types of cells, while precursor cells are unipotent cells that can only differentiate into a particular type of cells). HSC is at the apex of the hierarchy of bone marrow progenitors, maintaining a normal volume of hematopoietic tissue over time, increasing it if needed. In the bone marrow are present many progenitor cells: - 60% give rise to granulocytes’ lineage. 25% are erythroblasts and give rise to RBCs’ lineage. 15% give rise to lymphoid lineage, platelets, and fibroblasts’ precursors. Fig.3 After the totipotent stem cell, two stem cells lineages are produced (fig.4): Fig.4 1. CFU-GEMM: colony forming units of granulocytes (G), erythrocytes (E), then monocytes (M) (which differentiate into macrophages in the different tissues) and megakaryocytes (M); it brings to the formation of all the myeloid lineage. To be remembered about erythrocytes’ lineage: - Proerythroblast, containing specific receptors for EPO on the surface that stimulate the differentiation of the lineage when detected. Basophilic erythroblast - Polychromatic erythroblast - Reticulocyte, which the last precursor of the red blood cells and it is already released into the blood. There is a condition called reticulocytosis which consist in the presence of a lot of reticulocytes in the blood. Erythrocytes 2. CFU-L: colony forming unit of lymphocytes, giving rise to the lymphoid lineage. Stem cells initially proliferate repeatedly forming a proliferative compartment. Then the proliferative activity slows down (because their proliferation ability decreases) and they start differentiating and maturating start, this process occurs in a particular compartment of the bone marrow called maturation-proliferation compartment. At the end, the cells lose their ability to proliferate and these non-proliferating cells in the advanced maturation state accumulate in the maturation compartment. This is followed by the storage and functional compartment. There is not a storage compartment, in the bone marrow, for the erythrocytes. Instead, there is a storage compartment for granulocytes, they get released in the blood in case of need (e.g. during acute inflammation, Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 2 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 or in the presence of a damage in a tissue). Cells lifespan in the bone marrow and outside of it varies (fig.5): - Neutrophils are found in the bone marrow in the proliferation-maturation compartment and storage as well, some of them are functional in the peripheral blood (50%), they are the only one emigrating to peripheral tissues, where they exert their macrophagic function. Platelets and erythrocytes, as they are just formed, are released and do not form a storage compartment in the bone marrow. In fact, all erythrocytes are present in circulation, they remain there for 120 days and then become senescent and die, there is no storage compartment. Fig.5 BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT (HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT): Malignant Disease: Acute Myeloid Leukaemia/Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia - Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia/Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Non-Malignant Diseases: Aplastic anaemia Severe Combined Immune Deficiency Syndrome (SCID) Thalassemia Sickle Cell anaemia Fanconi anaemia RETICULOCYTES They are immature RBCs, consisting in the last passage of the differentiation and they are released in the blood. In the blood there might be reticulocytosis, indicating high levels of reticulocytes when new RBCs are requested by the body, in case of anaemia or conditions such as anaemia, hypobaropathy. They differentiate from RBCs for still possessing nuclei and some mitochondria, they can still synthesise Hb, after 24/48 they become RBCs, which are anucleated (for this reason they appear pale in the centre) and biconcave, they cannot synthesise new haemoglobin. Formation of red blood cell: - Progressive nuclear condensation → elimination of nucleus- Progressive accumulation of Hb Quantity of reticulocytes: 0.5%/1.5% of all erythrocytes present in the bloodstream (both mature and immature). The daily loss of 1% of the erythrocytes is balanced by an equal production of reticulocytes. HEMATOPOIETIC GROWTH FACTORS (HGF) Hematopoietic growth factors contribute to the production of blood cells. There are many of them, the most Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 3 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 important are Multi colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or IL3, and EPO (which stimulates the differentiation of erythrocytes in the bone marrow). The rate of production of EPO is controlled by hypo-oxygenation of tissues, inducing erythropoiesis. In case of hypoxia (e.g., in hypobaropathy) kidneys and liver produce EPO, which goes into the bone marrow, binds to its receptor located on the surface of pro-erythroblasts and stimulates their differentiation into erythrocytes. By doing this EPO induce bone marrow hyperplasia (cell adaptation in which the specific tissue increases in dimension, because the cells composing that tissue are increasing in number). The main transcription factor that regulate the expression and synthesis (and the release by the kidneys) of EPO is HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1). HIF-1 is normally present in sarcoplasm in the form of a heterodimer composed by two subunits, alpha and beta subunits. In normal conditions (when the level of oxygen is normal), the alpha subunit is hydroxylated (this reaction is favored by oxygen), after that it is ubiquitinated (bound to ubiquitin), in this way it is marked for proteosome degradation (this system is called ubiquitin-proteosome system and it is activated). The proteosome recognize this subunit and degrades it. In this way HIF-1 is not working and can’t induce the synthesis of EPO. In case of hypoxia, the alpha subunit is not hydroxylated (the enzyme regulating hydroxylation is not activated by oxygen) and, hence, it can’t be ubiquitinated and degraded by proteosome. Hence, HIF-1 remains active and it is able to translocate in the nucleus and binds to specific site of the DNA leading to the over expression of genes encoding for EPO. Another important factor is the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which is involved in angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is stimulated in case of hypoxia, and it is also an important process in case of a tumor. MONOCYTE-MACROPHAGE CELL LINE (Fig.6) After being formed, monocytes go into bloodstream, once in the tissue monocytes can differentiate into macrophages, by expressing and synthesize new molecules on cell’s surface, able to recognize foreign bodies present in the environmental space. They are pivotal in chronic inflammation (while the exit of neutrophils from blood is the main key-point process in acute inflammation). Fig.6 CHARACTERISTICS OF RBCS cellular component. - Their plasma membrane is particularly flexible (deformable), as RBCs have to pass in small capillaries changing their physical characteristics (they run from 300 to 400 km along vessels that also They are responsible for transport of O2 to the tissue, and CO2 to the pulmonary alveoli. Since this transport takes place via hemoglobin, it has the task of maintaining the functionality of this have a smaller diameter than its own, so it must be able to change The diameter of a RBC is about 8 μM, thickness of about 2.5 μM at the periphery and 0.8 μ M in the centre; average life of about 120 days ; By observation of a blood smear (fig.8) , they normally have the size of a nucleus of a small lymphocyte, whose nucleus completes almost all of its surface. If smaller, then the patient is affected by a microcytic anaemia , if bigger macrocytic anaemia . its shape), and if they are not deformable, they break down → Fig.7 haemolytic anaemia. The nucleus is not present (anucleated). In a transversal section (fig.7) they look biconcave (in the middle it is empty), from upwards they look circular and less coloured in the centre. Fig.8 Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 4 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 HAEMOGLOBIN (HB) Fig.9 adults, composed of 2α-2β globin chains. - Hb A2 type - making up 3% of all Hb in adults, composed of 2α and 2δ chains. - Foetal Hb - composed of 2α and 2γ chains; after birth it is completely substituted by the standard ones. Hb (fig.9) is composed of 4 globin chains bound to the heme group, consequently binding iron. There are 3 types of Hb: - Hb A type(fig.10) - making up 97% of all Hb in ANEMIAS Fig.10 It is a non-malignant blood disease, consisting in the reduction of the Hb concentration and/or of the number of red blood cells below normal limits(fig.2) in subjects of the same age and same sex. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced, leading to tissue hypoxia. They can be classified according to morphological or pathophysiological criteria. MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION\n\n**Basing on the red cell size (evaluated by MCV):**\n- Microcytic anaemia - the dimension of the RBC is lower than the normal one. Normocytic anaemia - the dimension of the RBC remains unchanged (what changes is the number of erythrocytes). Macrocytic anaemia - the dimension of the RBC is bigger than the normal one.\n\n**Basing on the degree of hemoglobinization, which is reflected on the colour of red cells and indicates the quantity of Hb:**\n- Normochromic anaemia. Hypochromic anaemia, paler. There are also conditions in which anemias addressed as hyperchromic, but in these cases the color is not due to an increased in the quantity of Hb but it is due an increased size of the cells (macrocytic anemias).\n\n**Basing on the shape of red cells – morphology (fig.11) (the professor prefers this method of classification):**Blood smear allows the identification of abnormalities in the morphology of the red cells → poikilocytosis, the shape of RBCs is different from the normal one. The correct identification of the specific type of poikilocytes allows to distinguish the various forms of anaemia, the shape might be anomalous:\n- Sickle cells anaemia→ the RBCs look like a sickle. Acanthocytosis→ deformation appears on the surface (at the level of the membrane) and might be due to accumulation of cholesterol. Spherocytosis→ circular shape (not biconcave) due to alteration of cytoskeleton. It is a hemolytic anemia. - Elliptocytosis→ elliptic shape, their volume is unchanged, but they are more rigid, RBCs are trapped and destroyed in smaller vessels → hemolytic anaemia. Sideropenic anaemia→ paler RBCs and smaller than usual (hypochromic-microcytic anaemia). It’s caused by iron deficiency. Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 5 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 Megaloblastic anaemia→ due to the deficiency of vitamin B12, cells look bigger and can be destroyed in smaller vessels. Fig.11 Q: “What is the difference between megaloblastic and macrocytic anemia?” A: “I’ll show you later, however in macrocytic the mature red blood cells are bigger than normal, megaloblastic anemia is the same type of anemia but is mainly referred to the precursors in the bone marrow, which are bigger than normal. Most of the time these bigger precursors die in the bone marrow, however sometimes they can mature and give rise to bigger erythrocytes”. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICALCLASSIFICATION Pathophysiological classification is based on the etiology and characteristics of diseases. They all cause a state of hypoxia in the tissues, but the cause of their origin is different. 1.Anemias of blood loss, hemorrhagic conditions. 2.Anemias of reduced erythropoiesis, bone marrow is not able to produce the right amount RBCs. It is caused by a damage to the stem compartment (aplasia) or a damage to the proliferating compartment. If the cell damaged is the totipotent stem cell, all blood elements are lacking (this condition is called pancytopenia). a.Aplastic anaemia b.Pure red cell aplasia c.Anemias due to chronic renal failure d.Anemias due to endocrine disorders e.Anemias due to altered DNA synthesis → due to vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g. pernicious anaemia) or due to folate deficiency. f.Anemias due to altered heme synthesis→ iron deficiency anaemia. g.Anemias due to decreased synthesis of globin → thalassemia syndrome. 3. Hemolytic anemias caused by RBCs excessively destroyed in blood, though their production is regular. a)Hemolytic anemias with intra-globular defects: I. Intrinsic defects in the red blood cell membrane → hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, acanthocytosis. II. Extrinsic factors→e.g. immune reaction or in runners (their continuous running brings to the continuous destruction of RBCs). III. Defects in the Hb structure→ sickle cell disease. Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 6 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 IV. Red cell enzyme defects → PK deficiency, G6PD deficiency. b)Hemolytic anemias with extra-globular defects I. Antibody-mediated destruction→ hemolytic disease of the newborn II. Resulting from trauma to red cells III. From infectious, chemical, and physical agents Keep in mind that sometimes you can find, for example, pernicious anemia and/or thalassemia syndrome classified among hemolytic anemias. That’s because, from the pathophysiological point of view thalassemia syndrome are caused by a decreased synthesis of globin, hence there is a reduced production of RBCs, but the produced RBCs are not normal and they may be destroyed in the circulation. To sum up, classifying thalassemia syndrome (or pernicious anemia) as hemolytic anemia is not a mistake, as it’s not a mistake classifying it among the anemia of reduced erythropoiesis. ANEMIA OF BLOOD LOSS In this type of anemia, the red blood cells are lost due to an hemorrhage. Characterized by normocytic and normochromic anemia. Immediately after the blood loss, anemia may appear less severe than how it turns out later. 24-48 hours after the blood loss, the blood volume (just the volume, not the quantity of RBCs) is rapidly restored by the intravascular shift of water from the interstitial fluid compartment. Hemodilution takes place (lowering of the hematocrit), the production of new erythrocytes does not occur immediately, when bleeding stops there is hyperplasia of the erythroid series (bone marrow hyperplasia) mediated by the EPO. Generally new RBCs are produced when erythrocytes come at the end of their life span. The reduction in oxygenation triggers increased secretion of erythropoietin from the kidney, which stimulates the proliferation of committed erythroid progenitors (CFU-E) in the marrow. It takes about 5 days for the progeny of these CFU-Es to mature and appear as newly released red cells (reticulocytes) in the peripheral blood. Possible exam question (mentioned in 2021-2022’ lecture): Reduced amount of RBCs synthesis is not compensated with compensation of more Hb produced, but of progenitors’ hyperplasia in the bone marrow. What kind of process is this hyperplasia of the bone marrow? → cell adaptation (reversible increase in the number of tissues of a certain tissue). If the stimulus that started the process comes back to normal (O2 supply in this case) it goes back to physiological conditions. For normoplasia to be restored, there must be the induction of cell apoptosis of those proliferated cells. ANEMIA OF REDUCED ERYTHROPOIESIS Fig.12 a)Aplastic anaemia. It is a disease concerning the cause progressive weakness, pallor, and dyspnea. Primitive causes → hereditary Fanconi’s syndrome, present in hereditary pancytopenia and idiopathics . There are 23 genes causing the syndrome, leading to bone marrow failure, progressive damage and failure of the pluripotent stem cell, and a high predisposition of cancer. totipotent/pluripotent stem cell (fig.12), leading to bone marrow failure and its hypocellularity. Consequently, all blood cells reduce in number → pancytopenia (leukocytes, and platelets are reduced too, causing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia). Anaemia can Secondary causes ➢chemical agents (benzene, xylol, insecticides) ➢physical agents (ionizing radiations) ➢drugs (cytostatics,arsenic compounds, anticonvulsants) ➢infectious agents (viral hepatitis, tuberculosis) Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 7 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 The damaged stem cells can give rise to a stem cell apparently identical to the original one but with reduced proliferative an differentiative capacity (leading to bone marrow aplasia), or, eventually, they can bring to the expression of specific molecules (new antigens) to the surface of stem cells, which are immediately recognized and stimulate an autoimmune reaction. Hence, the stem cells are destroyed, or they slowdown in differentiation and proliferation, leading to failure of bone marrow. Fig.13 Fig.13 shows a biopsy of the bone marrow, the precursor of all lineages (myeloid lineage and lymphoid lineage) normally occupies spaces which here are replaced by adipocytes (the white cells in fig.13). When the slide is prepared sulfate is used. Fanconi’s anaemia(fig.14): it’s an example of aplastic anemia, due to a hereditary condition. It is characterised by bone marrow aplasia and consequently pancytopenia. It presents mutations in several genes (twenty-two FA genes), leading to bone marrow failure and high predisposition to cancer (breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility). Fanconi’s anemia is not only characterised by a very sever aplastic anemia, but also by skeletal malformations, cardiac defects, short stature and a lot other clinical features. b)Pure cell aplasia Primary marrow disorder in which only erythroid progenitors are suppressed, the bone marrow is aplastic. In severe cases, red cell Fig.14 progenitors are completely absent from the marrow, due to a specific proliferative defect of the precursors of the red cells. Leukocytes and platelets are normal, there are different types: ➢Acquired (haemolytic anemias, infections, or drug exposure) ➢Constitutional Bone marrow cellularity is normal (despite the severe lack of erythrocyte precursors). The erythroid series may be missing entirely or be blocked at the erythroblast stage. c)Anemias due to chronic renal failure It is a normochromic and normocytic anemia characterized by a decreased production and increased destruction of erythrocytes. The decreased production of RBCs is due both to a metabolic damage to the erythroblasts, and to a decreased production of EPO from the kidneys to proerythroblasts. The main cause is the reduced production of EPO → Treatment: EPO administration. d)Anemias of endocrine disorders It is a normochromic and normocytic anemia. It is due to hormone deficiencies affecting erythropoiesis such as those found in hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency) and hypogonadism. e)Anemias due to altered DNA synthesis They are mainly related to deficiency in vitamin B12 (e.g. pernicious anemia) and folic acids (vitamin B9), necessary for DNA synthesis. Both types of anaemia are megaloblastic, in the bone marrow it is possible to find bigger precursors than normal ones. The deficiency results in this a abnormal size, and they are directly destroyed in the bone marrow (intra-medullary death) as they have difficulties passing over it → ineffective erythropoiesis. In the blood there aren’t enough RBCs. The few RBCs found in the blood are bigger than normal, and they might be destroyed as well in the periphery → might be classified also as haemolytic anaemia. Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 8 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 The impairment in the DNA production, brings to the formation of big cells with a defective nuclear maturation, they try to proliferate becoming bigger, but then they are not able to divide due to nucleus - cytoplasm asynchronicity. The cytoplasm is not proportional to the nucleus, resulting in bigger than physiological circumstances. The large erythroid precursors and RBCs are destroyed, and bone marrow hyperplasia is stimulated, being a response to less O2 supply and increased levels of growth factors, such as EPO. Anemias due to altered synthesis of DNA often give rise to pancytopenia, because the difficulty in proliferating involves all the types of cells. ➢Vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is proteins (thanks to the action of pepsin) and binds to a salivary protein called haptocorrin (green in fig.15) , forming the vitamin B12-haptocorrin complex. -Then, the thanks to the action of pancreatic enzymes (proteases) haptocorrin is dissociated from vit. B12 and, always in the stomach, the action of pepsin allows vit. B12 to bind to an intrinsic factor (F1) , which is produced by the gastric parietal cells. - In the intestine (at the level of the terminal ileum) the vit. B12-F1 complex finds specific receptors (called cubilin ) for the intrinsic factor itself. In this way, B12 fundamental for DNA synthesis. Metabolism of vitamin B12 (fig.15): it is taken up with the diet and synthesized by the intestinal flora. Vit. B12 is contained in foods of animal origin, hence, people who follow a vegan diet (and do not assume extra vit. B12) might have a deficiency of this vitamin. Vitamin B12 is bound to binding proteins contained in food: - In the stomach, the vitamin is freed from the binding is absorbed. Fig.15 - In the blood vitamin B12 is transported by a group of proteins: transcobalamin. In case of a deficiency of vit. B12 or folate, the nucleic maturation is not carried on, due to altered DNA synthesis. However, cytoplasmic maturation and Hb Fig.16 maturation proceed regularly → nucleus - cytoplasm asynchronicity (the nucleus is small, and the cytoplasm is very big). This causes the formation of larger precursors - megaloblastic precursors (fig.16) - in the bone marrow, most of them are destroyed in the bone marrow (ineffective hematopoiesis) and, those that mature, result macrocytic and they are destroyed in the peripheral vessels (hemolytic anaemia). It should be normochromic. In the blood smear (fig.17) peculiar neutrophils can be found, being hypersegmented and six- lobed nucleus. It can also be noticed the poikilocytosis (the RBCs have different shapes, some are bigger, some are smaller, some are elongated and so on) and anisocytosis (difference in size). An example of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anaemia: it is due to vitamin B12 deficiency, lack of absorption, due to an autoimmune disorder. It is characterized by the presence of auto-antibodies against the intrinsic factor, masking its binding site to Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 9 02.03.2023 GAMBA L.1 Fig.17 the one of the vit B12 (anti-F1 auto-Ab), or auto-antibodies against the parietal cells of the stomach (anti-parietal auto-Ab) leading to the lack of production of F1. There is also an other auto-immune condition in which the auto- antibodies bind the receptors for the vit. B12-F1 complex in the gut. In all these cases the vitamin is not absorbed. Characteristics of pernicious anaemia: - Fundic gland atrophy and metaplastic change (intestinalization: the cells of the stomach differentiate in cells similar to the one present at the level of the gut. It is a precancerous condition) → when antibodies are directed to enterocytes. NB: parenteral administration of vitamin B12 corrects the megaloblastic changes in the marrow but gastric atrophy persists. NB: The gastric atrophy and metaplastic changes are due to autoimmunity and not vit B12 deficiency! - Atrophic glossitis (the tongue becomes shiny, glazed and “beefy”). Spastic paresis, sensory ataxia and severe paresthesias in the lower limbs. ➢Folate deficiency, Folic acid is fundamental for the synthesis of DNA. It is mostly present in our blood in the form of methyltetrahydrofolate. Recap: Classification of anemias is based on their pathophysiology: 1.Anemias due to blood loss. 2.Anemias due to diminished erythropoiesis, among the different types were included the ones due to: e) Altered DNA synthesis, due to: I. Vitamin B12 deficiency (fig.18), which is macrocytic for the presence of megaloblasts, producing RBCs being bigger than usual, they cannot mature in the bone marrow and die. Anyway, some of the RBCs can mature and be released in the bloodstream, being bigger than normal. At the end they are destroyed at peripheral circulation, this type of anaemia can also be classified as hemolytic anaemia, for the presence of inefficient erythropoiesis and hemolysis. Folate deficiency (fig.18) II. Fig.18 3.Hemolytic anemias. Alice Bertozzi, Ekin Raman 10 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 ANEMIA LAST LESSON RECAP Classification of anemias is based on their pathophysiology: Anemias due to blood loss. Anemias due to diminished erythropoiesis, among the different types were included the ones due to: oAlteredDNA synthesis, due to: ▪ Vitamin B12 deficiency, which is macrocytic for the presence of megaloblasts, producing RBCs bigger than usual, that cannot mature in the bone marrow and die there. Anyways, some of the RBCs can mature and be released in the bloodstream, being bigger than normal. However, at the end, they are destroyed at the level 0of the peripheral circulation. This type of anemia can also be classified as hemolytic anemia, for the presence of inefficient erythropoiesis and hemolysis. ▪ Folate deficiency Hemolytic anemias, in which we have less red blood cells because of an increased hemolysis. ANEMIA DUE TO DIMINISHED ERYTHROPOIESIS ANEMIADUETOALTEREDDNASYNTHESIS VITAMIN B12DEFICIENCY Lack of vitamin B12 can drive from:\n\n**Decreased or inadequate intake of vitamin**\n\n**Vegetarian diet (B12 is mainly found in food of animal origin)**\n\n**Impaired absorption due to Intrinsic factor deficiency, which can be caused by:**\nan autoimmune response against the Intrinsic factor Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 11 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 an autoimmune response against the gastric parietal cells of the stomach that produce the intrinsic factor for absorption of vitamin B12. → pernicious anemia In case of pernicious anemia, megaloblasts are found in the bone marrow and macrocytic RBCs are found in the bloodstream. ANEMIADUETOALTEREDHEMESYNTHESIS IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA It can be caused by: deficiency of iron, necessary for heme synthesis Defective iron uptake Increased iron requirement (pregnancy and lactation) Altered use of iron Faulty synthesis of heme Chronic blood loss fig.1 It is a microcytic anemia. In order to notice it, it is necessary to observe the blood smear and compare the dimension of the red cells with the nucleus of a lymphocyte (the dark purple cell). In normal conditions they have the same dimension but in this case the red cells are much smaller. It is a hypochromic anemia: red cells are less colored than normal. The central pale area (due to the absence of a nucleus) is larger than in normal cells, where it is ⅓ the diameter of the erythrocyte. Furthermore, it is also possible to highlight the alteration in the shape of erythrocytes. Looking at this blood smear (fig.2) we can observe a microcytic and hypochromic anemia, characterized by the presence of normal cells (the more colored erythrocytes) which are due to a recent blood transfusion. There are also different shapes of erythrocytes in the same blood smear and this phenomenon is called poikilocytosis. In fact in the smear (fig.2) some cells are round, some others are very elongated (pencil cells). fig.2 IRONMETABOLISM The dietary iron intake is 20 mg/day and to maintain a normal iron balance, about 1 mg of iron must be absorbed from the diet every day. This is due to the fact that only 10% of the iron that we ingest is actually absorbed. It is estimated that men usually intake more iron than necessary, for it has been estimated that men eat meat more than women. Iron is absorbed in the gut, by the duodenum and proximal jejunum. About 85% of the absorbed iron is transported in the blood by iron-binding glycoproteins, such as transferrin, and is incorporated into the maturing red blood cells (in the bone marrow) thanks to specific receptors. When senescent erythrocytes are removed from the circulation through the spleen (after 120 days), Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 12 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 hemoglobin is degraded and iron is recycled. Free iron is present also in vegetables, but mainly present in the oxidized form Fe3+ (ferric iron). Proteins located on the surface of the epithelial cells such as duodenal cytochrome B (ferrireductase) reduce iron in the form Fe2+ (ferrose iron), easier to absorb. The acidic environment present in the stomach, and also the ascorbic acid (vitamin C), facilitate the maintenance of iron in the reduced form. Onceinside the mucosal cells, iron can bind ferritin , then it can either - Non-heme iron → DMT1 transporter, more difficult to be absorbed. Excess iron is accumulated as hemosiderin (disorganized aggregates of iron) or ferritin (ordered aggregates of iron with apoferritin). fig.3 Iron absorption - gut Food iron can be absorbed in two different ways (fig.4): - Heme iron (that we eat in meat) → easily absorbed through heme transporter, 25% of heme iron is absorbed directly from the gut. remain inside the cell without being used to produce red blood cells or it can pass into the circulation through ferroportin, which is a transporter located in the basal membrane of the mucosal cells. Ferroportin is regulated by hepcidin, a protein produced by the liver, which once produced inhibits ferroportin. Instead, when RBCs need to be produced1, the liver slows down the production of hepcidin so that ferroportin is not inhibited and iron is absorbed more efficiently → negative loop. Once iron has passed through ferroportin, it can enter the blood and, once oxidized again in ferric iron, it binds a protein called transferrin, that transport iron in the bone marrow, where it finds on the surface of erythroid precursor, some specific receptors that have high affinity with tranferrin iron. So, the erythroid precursors absorb iron through receptor-mediated endocytosis and then iron is used for heme synthesis. Once in the bone marrow, iron will be used to produce erythrocytes while, once in the liver, it will act as a signal increasing the production of hepcidin. 1in case of anemias, haemorrhages or hypobaropathies → hyperoxygenation of the tissue → EPO production → bone marrow hyperplasia. Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 13 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 fig.4 Causes of iron deficiencies:\n\n**Insufficient intake with diet (vegetarianism/veganism).**\n\n**Defective iron uptake**\n\n**Increased iron requirement (pregnancy, lactation)**\n\n**Chronic blood loss because of a gastrointestinal or genitourinary (females) hemorrhage (the most frequent cause).**\n\n**Chronic inflammatory disorders, altered use of iron in chronic diseases.**\n\n**sideroblastic anemias:**iron is accumulated in the bone marrow but is not used for the synthesis of heme, so it accumulates in the mitochondria of erythroblasts, altering their functions. Intramedullary death of erythroid precursor (ineffective erythropoiesis).\nThis type of anemia can be: - Idiopathic - Secondary to inflammatory diseases, neoplasms, drugs and ethanol. ANEMIASDUETODECREASEDSYNTHESISOFGLOBIN THALASSEMIA SYNDROMES Thalassemia syndromes might be classified also among hemolytic anemias. They are diffused in the Mediterranean basin and are a heterogeneous group of disorders. They are caused by inherited mutations that decrease the synthesis of either: - α-globin chain - β-globin chain Both of them compose adult hemoglobin, therefore the reduced synthesis of these chains leads to the formation of an abnormal hemoglobin and this causes the aggregation of hemoglobin in the plasma membrane. This leads to the formation of rigid red blood cells, that are destroyed in the peripheral bloodstream, characterizing thalassemia by hemolysis of RBCs→ hemolytic anemia. This type of anemia is put in second class, because the aggregation of four α chains or β chains already occurs in the bone marrow, so, the precursors of the red blood cells are already abnormal, too rigid, and they usually die in the bone marrow → reducedineffective erythropoiesis. Haemoglobin A (α2β2) abnormalities lead to anemia, tissue hypoxia, and red cell hemolysis related to imbalance in globin chain synthesis. β-thalassemia represents a chronic state of ineffective erythropoiesis (due to the death of erythrocyte precursors). Thalassemias are hypochromic and microcytic anemias. We can Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 14 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 divide them in:\n\n**β-Thalassemia:**caused by a deficient synthesis of β chains\n\n**α-Thalassemia:**caused by a deficient synthesis of α chains\nIn fig.5 is present a blood smear of a patient suffering from β-thalassemia, we can easily observe: Variation in size (Anisocytosis) Variation in shape (Poikilocytosis) Microcytosis Hypochromia (pale color of red cells) fig.5 Eventually, some pale erythrocytes have a pink dot in their centre, which represents only an accumulation of hemoglobin and NOT a nucleus. These cells are also called target cells2. Furthermore, we can see what resembles a nucleated erythrocyte, possessing a nucleus → purple dot in the centre, which is a normoblast, nucleated red cell precursor. They may be released into the blood. Β-THALASSEMIA It is caused by a nonsense point mutation3in the gene that leads to diminishing the synthesis of β-globin chains. It is the most common genetic disorder in the world. It is very widespread in the countries of the Mediterranean basin (Italy, mainly Sardinia, Sicily, Ferrara, and Greece), it accounts for 3 million cases, mostly heterozygous. It can be divided into:\n\n**Major (Homozygous-Cooley disease)**\n\n**Minor (Heterozygous disease)**\nMajor β-Thalassemia: is characterized by ineffective production of β-globin and Hemoglobin A is composed of 4 α-chains, instead of 2α-chains and 2 β-chains. This leads to an unstable hemoglobin that precipitates on the cell membrane of the RBCs precursors, making red blood cells very fragile and rigid. Particular types of hemolytic anemias are actually due to alterations in the plasma membrane of the RBCs since the membrane must be deformable to pass through 2 Cellule bersaglio, in italian 3 Nonsense point mutation changes the aa codon into a stop codon, truncating the protein, without function. Ex. beta globin gene: CAG (glutamine) → UAG (STOP codon) → autosomal recessive mutation, causing the protein to be rapidly degraded Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 15 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 the capillaries. The ineffective erythropoiesis leads to intramedullary deathof erythrocytes precursor and the remaining red cells, which circulate with a very low amount of hemoglobin and present numerous metabolic abnormalities, undergo hemolysis. The symptoms appear in the first year of life, being fatal in the first two decade of life: - Development deficit Alteration of all short bones (fig.6): anemia causes hypoxia, the kidneys begin to secrete - erythropoietin trying to increase the amount of erythrocytes and so trying to increase oxygenation of tissues. This leads to hyper proliferation of red blood cells precursors resulting in a hyperplasia of the bone marrow with the consequent deformity of the bones. fig.6 - Hepatic-splenomegaly: the spleen is rich in resident macrophages whose role is to destroy the old apoptotic red blood cells. In case of a non-physiological hemolysis, the amount of red blood cells to be destroyed increases and consequently also the resident macrophages increase, leading to the enlargement of this organ. Infections - - Cardiac complications - Iron accumulation in Heart and Liver due to a massive hemolysis that can lead to iron overload and Hemochromatosis. In fig.7 we see a normal erythroblast in the blood marrow, its hemoglobin has 2α2β chains, so also the red blood cells will be normal, because the bone marrow will release normal reticulocytes that will mature within 24-48 hours. In β-thalassemia, β globin is not synthesized, so in the plasma membrane we may find insoluble α globin aggregates that lead to the formation to abnormal and rigid erythroblasts in the bone marrow. Most erythroblast die intramedullary, and this leads to ineffective erythropoiesis. The kidney sense that there is an hypoxic condition in the tissue, and in response they release erythropoietin that go in the bone marrow, bind to specific receptors in the precursors and tries to stimulate erythropoiesis. In order to allow the formation of new precursor, we have to absorb bigger quantities of iron to create more heme. Sometimes iron absorption is too much in comparison to the one that is actually needed, so we can have a systemic iron overload. The few abnormal red cells that leave the bone marrow have α globin aggregates in the plasma membrane, so they are not deformable, so they are destroyed in the capillaries of the peripheral blood, but also at the level of the spleen, the liver. Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 16 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 fig.7 Minor β-Thalassemia: is the heterozygous form of β-thalassemia, meaning that it has only one mutated allele and that there is a reduction of 50% in the production of globin β chains. It is usually asymptomatic or mild and can aggravate in female patients during pregnancy or during severe infectious processes. HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS This type of anemias are characterised by an increased destruction of circulating red blood cells. They are divided into two groups:\n\n**Intra-globular defects (problems related to red blood cells)**\n\n**Extra-globular defects (problems related to something which is not a red blood cell)**\nIn physiological conditions, red blood cells undergo apoptosis when senescent (after 120 days). It is an active process that needs ATP resulting in the formation of apoptotic bodies, which are then digested by spleen resident macrophages. In pathological condition hemolysis can be classified as: - Intravascular (less common): RBCs are destroyed in the peripheral circulation due to a mechanical injury. Ex. this can happen during a marathon run, where RBCs are destroyed under the feet at each step, or in people who play drums with their hands, where RBCs break with each percussion (obviously after a long time of playing the instrument). Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 17 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 Extravascular (majority): is caused by alteration that renders RBC membranes less deformable, leading to their sequestration and phagocytosis by spleen resident macrophages. This process will lead to macrophages hyperplasia and so to splenomegaly. Hemolytic anemias share the following features: Shortened RBC life span (below the normal 120 days); Elevated erythropoietin levels and a compensatory increase in erythropoiesis (compensatory hyperplasia); Prominent reticulocytosis in the peripheral blood, due to increased erythropoiesis; Accumulation of hemoglobin degradation products (iron accumulation in the spleen, liver and bone marrow, hemosiderosis). Clinical manifestations: Variable grade anemia; Pre-hepatic jaundice (increase in the quantity of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, which comes from heme degradation); Asthenia and fatigue (low quantity of oxygen); Lower limb ulcers; Splenomegaly; Aplastic crisis; Skeletal abnormalities. fig.8 HEMOLYTICANEMIASWITHINTRA-GLOBULARDEFECTS INTRINSIC DEFECTS IN THE RED CELL MEMBRANE The shape and the elasticity of the RBC are guaranteed by the structure of the plasma membrane and by proteins located just below the plasma membrane, connecting the membrane with the cytoskeleton: spectrin and ankyrin. The deficiency of one of these two protein does not allow the erythrocyte to maintain the biconcave shape. fig.9 Spherocytosis is observed through molecular defects of these proteins. The aberrant RBCs (spherocytes) have a spherical shape, resulting less elastic and poorly deformable than normal ones, so they can die intravascularly or they can be retained by the spleen and then destroyed through hemolysis by macrophages. Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 18 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 Looking at a blood smear, they will not present the characteristic central pale area because they are not biconcave but completely spherical, so they appear homogeneously pink. It is an autosomal dominant inheritance with the highest prevalence in Northern Europe (1:5000) Patients affected by this disease can develop some complications:\n\n**Hemolytic crisis:**rapid worsening of anemia and jaundice, triggered by an infection.\n\n**Aplastic crises:**rapid fall in hemoglobin concentration precipitated by parvovirus B19 infection\n\n**Megaloblastic crisis:**worsening anemia resulting from severe Folate deficiency caused by\nincreased bone marrow requirement in hemolysis.\n\n**Skeletal abnormalities**\n\n**Leg ulcers**\nfig. 10 Elliptocytosis is another type of anemia which is very similar to the one just described, the only difference is that RBCs have an elliptic shape. Acanthocytosis is another type of hemolytic anemia, and it is due to an increased amount of cholesterol in the plasma membrane, which makes it less elastic. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is another type of hemolytic anemia, in which the malformation of the membrane occurs in the totipotent stem cells, giving rise to erythrocytes, platelets, monocytes and granulocytes with plasma membrane alterations that will cause hemolytic crisis, mainly during the night. Clinical features: Anemia Splenomegaly Jaundice Patients with HS can develop serious complications as: Hemolytic crisis: rapid worsening of anemia and jaundice, triggered by infection. Aplastic crisis: rapid fall in hemoglobin concentration precipitated by parvovirus B19 infection Megaloblastic crisis: worsening anemia resulting from severe folate deficiency, caused by increased bone marrow requirement in hemolysis. Other complications: pigmented gallstones, growth failure, skeletal abnormalities and leg ulcers. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS A 41yo white woman presented to the emergency department. She described fever, cough and exercise intolerance, yellowish discoloration of her eyes, and pain in the left upper quadrant that had been ongoing for three days. She had experienced three similar episodes in the past five years. Each episode resolved completely after treatment with antibiotics prescribed by her general practitioner. She had no other Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 19 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 notable medical condition or family history. She appeared pale and had scleral icterus. Her spleen was enlarged and palpable below the left costal margin, firm inconsistency, and mildly tender on palpation.\n\n**Examination of peripheral blood film revealed abnormalities in red blood cell morphology:**marked spherocytosis and polychromasia on peripheral blood smear\n\n**Ultrasonography of the abdomen confirmed splenomegaly with spleen size of 16 cm.**\nThe diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis, presenting a hemolytic crisis. In fig.11 is analyzed a blood smear: spherocytes are the cells pointed by the red arrows, while blue arrows point to reticulocytes. Polychromasia (reticulocytosis) is an important sign, which helps to understand that the bone marrow is functioning and has activated a hyperplastic mechanism with the aim to restore the normal amount of RBC. fig.11 The results of the laboratory investigations reported (fig.12):\n\n**Reduction in hemoglobin concentration, as spherocytes are destroyed peripherally.**\n\n**Increase of reticulocytes, because the bone marrow is trying to restore the normal amount**\nof RBCs.\n\n**Increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an enzyme released by cells that undergo necrosis**\n(due to the lack of functioning RBCs and so of a hypoxic condition of tissues).\n\n**Increase in bilirubin levels, resulting from an increase in heme destruction.**\n\n**Reduction in haptoglobin:**this protein is very important and is considered a markerof\nhemolytic anemia, it normally binds free hemoglobin. Keep in mind that, during lab analysis, we measure the amount of free haptoglobin (not bound to heme). In physiological conditions, we can detect a normal amount of this protein because there is no free heme in the blood circulation and so haptoglobin will not bind anything. Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa When there is hemolytic anemia, lots of heme is free in the blood. It will bind to haptoglobin and so the amount of haptoglobin measured in the lab will be smaller than normal. fig.12 Therapy: If the patient is asymptomatic, no treatment is 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 required Infections can precipitate hemolytic crisis in people with this condition Moderate/severe cases can require: Splenectomy Folic acid supplementation Regular blood transfusion, generally performed in young children. In fig.13 two blood smear of: Fig.13 fig.14: pathophysiology of HS Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 21 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 Defects in the haemoglobin structure 🡪 Sickle cell anemia The RBCs acquire a peculiar sickle shape. It is the most diffused disease of this category. It is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of β-globin gene that leads to the replacement of a glutamate acid with a valine residue (missense mutation). fig.15 The mutation promotes the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, leading to red cells distortion and consequently hemolytic anemia, micro vascular obstruction and ischemic tissue damage. Structurally abnormal Hb is less soluble than the native protein, especially in the deoxygenated form, it precipitates inside the RBC forming fibers that can damage the membrane. Falcization (acquisition of the sickle shape) of the erythrocyte is not constitutive (the RBC of an affected patient are not all sickle shaped) but occurs under specific conditions:\n\n**Hypoxia**\n\n**Increased acidity**\n\n**Temperature rise**\nAbout 8% to 10% of African Americans, or roughly 2 million individuals, are heterozygous for HbS, a largely asymptomatic condition known as sickle cell trait. The offspring of two heterozygotes has a 1 in 4 chance of being homozygous for the sickle mutation, a state that produces symptomatic sickle cell disease. In such individuals, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS (α2βs2). There are about 70,000 individuals with sickle cell disease in the United States. In certain populations in Africa the prevalence of heterozygosity is as high as 30% fig. 16 As we can see, the “sickle transition” does not last too long and does not excessively damage the membrane. When the intracellular calcium concentration increases and an augmented excretion of water Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 22 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 and potassium takes place, the cell becomes dehydrated. It can be reversed when the RBC is relatively young and is reoxygenated, at the end it will be again rehydrated. This cannot occur anymore when the RBC has become senescent. Irreversibly, sickle cells are destroyed mainly by the spleen and can also cause micro vascular occlusion leading to ischemic events at the level of tissue like chest, bones, abdomen and can cause pain. Clinical Features:\n\n**Sickled cells**\n\n**Reticulocytosis**\n\n**Hyperbilirubinemia**\n\n**Vaso-occlusive crises, also called pain crises (hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severe pain in the affected region. The most commonly involved sites are the bones, lungs, liver, brain, spleen, and penis)**\n\n**stroke and retinopathy leading to loss of visual acuity and even blindness**\nHEMOLYTIC DISEASE DUE TO RED CELL ENZYMES DEFECT The most important are two:\n\n**PK deficiency, due to the deficiency of the pyruvate kinase, an enzyme that is involved in the last phases of glycolysis.**\n\n**G6PD deficiency (Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) that leads to a disease called Favism. G6PD is fundamental for the antioxidant response of cells. It is responsible for the reduction of NADP+ in NADPH, which in turn is necessary for the conversion of oxidized glutathione into reduced glutathione (an important antioxidant). The lack of this important antioxidant causes hemoglobin to besusceptibleto oxidative stress:**\noIt will detach from the heme oIt will precipitate in the form of Heinz bodies making the red blood cell rigid. In turn Heinz bodies can also damage the membrane. This condition is also a hemolytic anemia. Favism, the condition that develops, is characterized by the after the ingestion of fava beans and peas and some drugs (such as Aspirin, sulfonamides, antibiotics, vitamin K). It is normocytic and normochromic. presence of Heinz Bodies: membrane-bound precipitates, dark inclusion bodies within red blood cells stained with crystal violet. Moreover, the cells look as bite, they are the result of the splenic macrophages plucking out the inclusion bodies. It is triggered A blood smear: fig.17 The most important characteristic is the “Bite cells”: are the result of the splenic macrophages plucking out the inclusion bodies. fig.17 HEMOLYTICANEMIASWITHEXTRA-GLOBULARDEFECTS 3 types: oAntibody mediated destruction oResulting from trauma to RBCs Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 23 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 oFrom infectious, chemical and physical agent Antibody-mediated destruction: hemolytic disease of newborns Immune hydrops or hydrops fetalis is a type of hemolytic anemia caused by an autoimmune reaction against RBCs: blood-group antigen incompatibility between mother and fetus, causing the accumulation of edema fluid in the fetus during intrauterine growth. Specific case: mother Rh- - father Rh+ - fetus Rh+ Generally in the first pregnancy it is not risky as the mother only produces IgM (don’t cross the placenta), but for the following ones, where IgG antibodies are formed (cross the placenta), it is. This particular type of hemolytic anemia is caused by Rh blood group incompatibility between mother and fetus: in particular, it happens in Rh positive fetuses carried by a mother presenting a Rh negative phenotype. Intrauterine fluid is accumulated on the fetal tissues: fig.18 It can be a generalised edema of the fetus (commonly known as hydrops fetalis), it is a usually lethal condition. A more localised edema is compatible with life and usually occurs in the post nuchal area. In this case it is known as “cystic hygroma”. The reaction occurs in second and subsequent pregnancies from a Rh negative mother and a Rh positive father, when the fetus inherits the Rh antigens from the father on its RBC. From the slides: Fetal RBCs can reach the maternal circulation only during the last trimester of pregnancy or during childbirth itself, thus the mother becomes sensitized to the foreign antigens. The initial exposure to Rh antigen (first pregnancy) evokes the formation of IgM antibodies. Exposure during a subsequent pregnancy generally leads to the formation of IgG and the risk of immune hydrops. D antigen is a major cause of Rh incompatibility. Concurrent ABO incompatibility protects the mother against Rh immunisation because the fetal red cells are promptly coated and removed from the maternal circulation by anti-A or anti-B IgM antibodies that do not cross the placenta. Administration of Rh-Ig (Rhesus Immune globulin containing anti-D antibodies) at 28 weeks of gestation and within 72 hours of delivery to Rh- negative mothers (first pregnancy or after abortions) significantly decreases the risk for hemolytic disease in Rh-positive neonates and in subsequent pregnancies. Fetal hemolysis caused by maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility (20-25% of pregnancy, severe in 1:200 cases). ABO hemolytic disease occurs almost exclusively in infants of group A or B who are born of group O mothers. Most anti-A and anti-B antibodies are of the IgM type and hence do not cross the placenta. Neonatal red cells express blood group antigens A and B poorly. Many cells other than red cells express A and B antigens and thus absorb some of the transferred antibody. For unknown reasons, certain group O women possess IgG antibodies directed against group A or B antigens (or both) even without prior Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 24 13.03.2023 GAMBA L.2 sensitization. Therefore, the first born may be affected. Consequences mild hemolysis, anemia. severe hemolysis causes hypoxic injury to all the body of the fetus, especially liver and heart, giving rise to reduced production of the main plasmatic proteins, causing a reduction of oncotic pressure and generalized edema. From the slides: → Anemia. If hemolysis is mild, increased red cell production may suffice to maintain near-normal levels of red cells. However, with more severe hemolysis, progressive anemia develops and may result in hypoxic injury to the heart and liver. Because of liver injury, plasma protein synthesis decreases, and levels of these proteins may drop to as low as 2 to 2.5 mg/dL. Cardiac hypoxia may lead to cardiac decompensation and failure. The combination of reduced plasma oncotic pressure and increased hydrostatic pressure in the circulation (secondary to cardiac failure) results in generalized edema, culminating in hydrops fetalis\n\n**Both the fetus and placenta are pale.**\n\n**Liver and spleen are enlarged.**\n\n**The bone marrow demonstrates compensatory hyperplasia of Erythroid.**\n\n**Extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and possibly other tissues such as the kidneys, lungs, and even the heart.**\n\n**Presence in the peripheral circulation of large numbers of immature red cells, including reticulocytes and erythroblasts (erythroblastosis fetalis).**\n\n**The most serious threat in fetal hydrops is CNS damage, known as kernicterus.**\n25 when sectioned, has a bright yellow color, particularly the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, cerebral grey matter and spinal cord. Fig.19 → Jaundice Jaundice develops since hemolysis causes the release in blood of unconjugated bilirubin, which can pass through the infant’s poorly developed BBB. Being water-insoluble, bilirubin binds to lipids in the brain and, since the brain is the organ with the highest amount of cholesterol, the presence of bilirubin can damage the CNS, causing kernicterus. The brain is enlarged and edematous and, Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa", "input": "", "output": "define the following, and give their normal values\n\n**hematocrit**\nis the volume occupied by RBCs, expressed in %.

In chronic bleeding conditions, blood volume is normal since it is constantly restored due to the fact that the patient, who will constantly feel dehydrated and thirsty, will be drinking a lot, and the kidneys will retain all of the water. Obviously, just the plasma is restored, but not the RBCs, since they have to be produced again by the bone marrow. Hemolytic anemias: Destruction of circulating RBCs, that may be due to intravascular hemolysis. Anemias of diminished erythropoiesis: Low or defective RBCs production by bone marrow, that may be due to stem cells problems (such as stem cells destruction, lacking raw material for RBCs production or also lacking stimuli for RBCs production), hemoglobinopathy (genetic disease that leads to the synthesis of abnormal Hb: sickle cell anemia, beta thalassemia, etc), leading to ineffective erythropoiesis with cells that have a very short life (elevated bone marrow production of damaged RBCs who immediately die).\n\n**Morphologic classification of anemias**\nBased on the MCV <82 fl: microcytic anemia 82-98 fl: normocytic anemia 98 fl macrocytic anemia Based on MHC <27 pg: hypochromic anemia 27-32 pg: normochromic Based on the shape: sickle cell anemia hereditary spherocytosis etc\n\n**Describe the anemias of blood loss**\nAnemias of blood loss are normocytic and normochromic.

The diagnosis rests on examination of a bone marrow biopsy: The bone marrow is hypocellular, consisting mainly of adipocytes.\n\n**Describe Fanconi Anemia**\nFanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, AR, genetic disease resulting in impaired response to DNA damage in the FA/BRCA pathway. FA is the result of a genetic defect in a cluster of proteins responsible for DNA repair via homologous recombination. There are 22 genes responsible for FA, the cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are examples of FA genes, The majority of affected individuals develop cancer, most often acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and liver tumors. 90% develop aplastic anemia (the inability to produce blood cells) by age 40. Treatment with androgens and hematopoietic growth factors can help bone marrow failure temporarily, but the long-term treatment is bone marrow transplant if a donor is available. About 60–75% have congenital defects, commonly short stature, abnormalities of the skin, arms, head, eyes, kidneys, and ears, and developmental disabilities. Around 75% have some form of endocrine problem, with varying degrees of severity.\n\n**Describe pure red cell aplasia**\nPrimary marrow disorder in which only erythroid progenitors are suppressed due a specific proliferative defect (Leukocytes and platelets are normal) In severe cases, red cell progenitors are completely absent from the marrow. There are multiple etiologies that can cause PRCA Acquired (autoimmune disease, infections, drugs, etc) Constitutional\n\n**Bone marrow cellularity is normal (despite the severe lack of**\nerythrocyte precursors) The erythroid series may be missing entirely or be blocked at the erythroblast stage.\n\n**describe anemias of endocrine disorders**\nthyroid hormones and androgens are important for erythropoiesis. which is why there are the anemias of endocrine disorders related to hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency) and hypogonadism. Normochromic and normocytic.\n\n**describe iron deficiency anemia**\nIron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia. It appears microcytic and hypochromic. There’s also a degree of Poikilocytosis (abnormal red blood cell shape that makes up 10% or more of the total population) as some cells appear elongated. The causes may be: Decreased iron consumption: daily intake 20mg (only 10% to 15% of ingested iron is absorbed) Lower iron absorption in duodenum and proximal jejunum. At least 1mg of iron must be absorbed daily. due to achlorhydria (PPIs ****or other causes) Iron loss acute/ chronic bleeding (menstruation, ulcers, etc.) Increased requirement pregnancy and lactation parasitic bowel infection (mainly in tropical countries) sideroblastic anemias: iron is accumulated in the mitochondria of erythroblasts in the bone marrow but is not used for the synthesis of heme and it alters their function → Intramedullary death of erythroid precursors (ineffective erythropoiesis)\n\n**what are the normal iron values in lab? which ones do we use to prove**\niron deficiency? Normal reference ranges are: TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity)= serum transferrin: 240–450 µg/dL Transferrin saturation: 20–50% Serum iron: Men: 65 to 176 µg/dL Women: 50 to 170 µg/dL Serum Ferritin: 30 - 300 µg/L for males, 30–160 µg/L for females.\n\n**IRON DEFICIENCY:**\nTIBC or Serum Transferrin: HIGH Transferrin Saturation (iron/TIBC x 100): LOW (<15%) Serum Ferritin: LOW (<30) N.B.: ferritin levels measured usually have a direct correlation with the total amount of iron stored in the body. However, ferritin levels may be artificially high in cases of anemia of chronic disease, where ferritin is elevated in its capacity as an inflammatory acute phase protein and not as a marker for iron overload\n\n**describe iron metabolism**\n**Iron metabolism:**The dietary iron intake: 20 mg/day. It is absorbed in the the duodenum and proximal jejunum\nIron absorption - gut: Food iron can be absorbed in two different ways: Heme iron → heme transporter, 25% of heme iron is absorbed directly from the gut. Non heme iron → DMT1 transporter, more difficult to be absorbed. Once inside the mucosal cell iron can bind a mucosal ferritin, it remains inside the cell without being used to produce red blood cells or it can pass into the circulation through ferroportin, which is a transporter located in the basal membrane of the mucosal cells is inhibited by hepcidin, a protein produced by the liver. When RBCs need to be produced the liver slows down the production of hepcidin so that ferroportin is not inhibited and iron is absorbed more efficiently. Once iron has passed through ferroportin, it can enter the blood and bind to a plasma transferrin, and be transported towards the bone marrow and towards the liver. Once in the bone marrow it will be used to produce erythrocytes while, once in the liver, it will act as a signal increasing the production of hepcidin. about 85% of the absorbed iron is transported in the blood by iron-binding glycoproteins, such as transferrin, and it is incorporated into the maturing red blood cells (in the bone marrow) thanks to specific receptors. When senescent erythrocytes are removed from the circulation through the spleen (after 120 days), hemoglobin is degraded and iron is recycled. Excess iron is accumulated as hemosiderin(disorganized aggregates of iron) or ferritin (ordered aggregates of iron with apoferritin).\n  \n**describe anemias due to decreased synthesis of globins (thalasemic syndromes)**\n\n**Thalassemias are autosomal recessive disorders that affect the production of hemoglobin. Thalassemias are hypochromic and**\nmicrocytic anemias. There’s also variation in shape (Poikilocytosis) In a blood smear some erythrocytes have a pink dot in their centre, which represents only an accumulation of hemoglobin and NOT a nucleus. These cells are also called target cells. Some erythrocyte precursors still containing a nucleus might be released from the bone marrow as well (normoblasts). Normally, the majority of adult hemoglobin is composed of two α and two β-globin chains arranged into a heterotetramer. In thalassemia, patients have defects in either the α or β-globin chain, causing production of abnormal red blood cells. Due to the aberrant chains, RBCs are rigid and they are destroyed in the peripheral bloodstream → hemolytic anaemia. Medullary hemolysis due to aberrant globin chains→ ineffective erythropoiesis. There are two main types depending on which chain is defective: Alpha Thalassemia Beta Thalassemia: nonsense point mutation in gene coding for beta Hb chain. Most often occurs in people of Mediterranean origin (anemia mediterranea) manifests in both homozygous and heterozygous, although the latter present less signs. in the homozygous, there are physical indications: development deficit Hepatic-splenomegaly: excessive macrophage hyperplasia due to hemolysis. Infections Cardiac complications Iron accumulation in Heart and Liver due to a massive Hemolysis can lead to iron overload and Hemochromatosis alteration of all short bones → chronic hyperplasia of the bone marrow with the consequent deformity of the bones ■ hypertrophy of the maxilla □ exposed upper teeth ■ periorbital puffiness ■ low nasal bridge ■ bossing of the skull\n\n**describe anemias due to defective DNA synthesis**\nVit. B12 and folate are coenzymes required for the synthesis of thymidine (DNA nucleotide T). Their deficiency results in deranged DNA synthesis leading to defective nuclear maturation that delays or blocks cell division. This results in ineffective hematopoiesis and the creation of abnormally large RBCs (megaloblastic anemias) → While nuclear maturation is delayed, cytoplasmic maturation and hemoglobin accumulation proceed at a normal pace, leading to nuclear-to-cytoplasmic asynchrony The defective RBCs lead to increased levels of EPO → marrow hyperplasia but if the deficiency persists most precursors undergo apoptosis due to deranged DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 deficiency in most cases is secondary to lack of intrinsic factor (F1) → PERNICIOUS ANEMIAAutoimmune disease, characterized by the presence of auto-Ab that attack on the gastric mucosa (anti-parietal cells or anti-F1 or anti-ileal receptor). gastric atrophy chronic gastritis Atrophic glossitis (the tongue becomes shiny, glazed and “beefy”). Spastic paresis, sensory ataxia and severe paresthesias in the lower limbs.\n\n**Methylcobalamin serves as an essential cofactor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase:**methylcobalamin yields a methyl group that is recovered from N5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, the principal form of folic acid in plasma, which is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid (FH4). FH4 is a crucial cofactor for the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), a building block for DNA.\n\n**what can be the cause of a folate or vitamin 12 deficiency?**\nfolate deficiency can develop very quickly in days or weeks due to lack of introduction in the diet. B12 (cyanocobalamin) is a water soluble vitamin that needs intrinsic factor produced by the parietal cells or chief cells of the stomach to be absorbed. The B12-IF complex can only be absorbed at the distal ileum. B12 storage lasts from 5 to 10 years, which is why if the patient stops absorbing or consuming it now, the effects on the RBC will not be immediate but will appear 5 to 10 years form now. Vit. B12 Deficiency can be due to: inadequate dietary intake (Vegan → anamnesis) gastrectomy (anamnesis) autoimmune atrophic gastritis → parietal cell destruction endoscopy shows atrophy of gastric wall celiac disease anamnesis, colonoscopy + biopsy, IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA): This is the most sensitive and commonly used test for celiac disease. IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA): EMA antibodies are highly specific for celiac disease. IgA anti-deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP-IgA): These antibodies may also be elevated in celiac disease. pancreatic insufficiency (serum amylase and lipase, anamnesis) lack of intrinsic factor due to defect in gastric cells surgical removal of the distal ileum (anamnesis) chronic IBS (anamnesis) Crohn’s disease (affects the distal ileum) ■ a patient with Crohn’s disease will first develop microcytic anemia due to impaired iron absorption and later will develop macrocytic anemia due to B12 malabsorption, these two abnormalities can produce a false normal result.\n\n**what are the possible causes of macrocytic anemia?**\nThere are 3 main possibilities 1. Abnormal nucleic acid metabolism of erythroid precursors due to a deficiency in folate, cobalamin, or other important factors for the synthesis of RBC. 2. Defect in the bone marrow (leukemia, myelodysplasia, other blood cancers) ****leading to ****abnormal RBC maturation 3. Alcohol abuse → liver disease (unknown mechanism)\n\n**how should we proceed after finding a MCV >98 in a CBC?**\n1. reticulocyte count: reticulocytes are bigger than normal red blood cells, a high number of reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) will drive the MCV higher without there being an actual macrocytic anemia. 1. if reticulocyte count is normal, macrocytic anemia can be diagnosed. You proceed to check B12 and Folate levels. 2. If reticulocyte count is elevated: could be the bone marrow overcompensating for RBC loss (check for hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia..)\n\n**what are the possible causes of microcytic anemia?**\nbeta thalassemia iron deficiency anemia\n\n**what are the hemolytic anemias?**\nHemolytic anemias with RBC (intraglobular) defects in the cell membrane: defect in proteins located just below the plasma membrane, connecting the membrane with the cytoskeleton: spectrin and ankyrin do not allow RBC to maintain the biconcave shape. Hereditary spherocytosis (It is an autosomal dominant inheritance with the highest prevalence in Northern Europe, 1:5000) extravascular hemolysis in spleen due to spherical shape of RBC. Mutation is in the genes that code for spectrin (alpha and beta), ankyrin, band 3 protein, protein 4.2, and other red blood cell membrane proteins Elliptocytosis: All RBCs have an elliptical shape. The clinical features are similar to those of HS but tend to be milder; splenomegaly is often present. Acanthocytosis ↑ cholesterol in pm makes it less elastic. The red blood cells are devoid of the typical central light area and have irregular projections similar to spines (excess cholesterol in RBC membranes) in hemoglobin structure sickle cell anemia in enzymes involved in glycolysis Pyruvate Kinase (PK) deficiency: Most frequent cause of congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia; normochromic and normocytic anemia. It causes ATP deficiency. It manifests only in homozygous. Chronic hemolysis due to reduced erythrocyte survival. Jaundice, stones and splenomegaly Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency “Favism” Hemolytic anemias with extraglobular defects antibody mediated hemolytic disease of the newborn resulting from trauma to RBCs Infections, physical and chemical\n\n**Depending on where the hemolysis takes place we can classify them**\nin: Intravascular (less common): RBC are destroyed in the peripheral circulation due to a mechanical injury. Extravascular (majority): is caused by alteration that renders RBC membranes less deformable, leading to their sequestration and phagocytosis by spleen resident macrophages. This process will lead to macrophages hyperplasia and so to splenomegaly\n\n**Hemolytic anemias share the following features:**\nShortened RBC life span below the normal 120 days Elevated erythropoietin levels and a compensatory increase in erythropoiesis (compensatory hyperplasia) Prominent reticulocytosis in the peripheral blood, due to increased erythropoiesis. Accumulation of hemoglobin degradation products (iron accumulation in the spleen, liver and bone marrow, Hemosiderosis) Clinical manifestations: Pre-hepatic jaundice (increase in the quantity of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood which comes from heme degradation). Asthenia and fatigue (low quantity of oxygen) Lower limb ulcers Splenomegaly Hemolytic crisis: : rapid worsening of anemia and jaundice, triggered by infection Megaloblastic crises: worsening anemia resulting from severe folate deficiency caused by increased bone marrow requirement in haemolysis. Skeletal abnormalities\n\n**Moderate to severe cases require:**• Splenectomy • Folic acid supplementation • Regular blood transfusions (in younger children with severe HS before splenectomy)\n\n**describe sickle cell anemia**\nIt belongs to a category of anemias caused by defects in the hemoglobin structure. Structurally abnormal Hb, less soluble than the native protein, especially in the deoxygenated form → It precipitates inside the RBC forming fibers that can damage the membrane. SICKLE CELL ANEMIA is a common autosomal recessive disease. Heterozygotes (sickle cell trait) are usually asymptomatic; homozygotes have higher amounts of pathological Hb (HbS) → numerous sickling crises. The condition sickle cell trait reduces the mortality for Malaria. It is caused by a point, missense mutation in the β-globin that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residue. under low oxygen concentration, HbS polymerizes and forms fibrous precipitates that leads to the acquisition of the sickle shape. The erythrocyte becomes rigid and causes microvascular obstructions → tissue hypoxia → ischemic damage. Clinical features: Sickled cells Reticulocytosis Hyperbilirubinemia Vaso-occlusive crises, also called pain crises (hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severe pain in the affected region. The most commonly involved sites are the bones, lungs, liver, brain, spleen, and penis) stroke and retinopathy leading to loss of visual acuity and even blindness\n\n**Describe Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency “Favism”**\nGlucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to normocytic, normochromic, hemolytic anemia and to favism. It is is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide, inherited in an X-linked, recessive way → men! G6PD is necessary for the reduction of oxidized glutathione into reduced glutathione. The G6PD / NADPH pathway is the only source of reduced glutathione in red blood cells People with G6PD deficiency are therefore at risk of hemolytic anemia in states of oxidative stress, which can result from infection and from chemical exposure to medication and certain foods. e.g., fava beans, contain high levels of vicine, divicine, convicine and isouramil, all of which create oxidants. under oxidation, heme detaches from hemoglobin, it precipitates in the form of Heinz bodies deposition in the red cell membranes. Damaged red cells are phagocytosed and sequestered (taken out of circulation) in the spleen The hemoglobin is metabolized to bilirubin (causing jaundice at high concentrations).\n\n**explain the hemolytic disease of the newborn**\nGlycoprotein can be present (Rh+), or absent (Rh-) Rh- person makes **IgG** antibodies against the glycoprotein after being exposed to Rh+ once.\n**IgG antibodies cross placental barrier**\nIf a mother has an Rh+ child and she herself of Rh-, then during the first birth she will develop IgG antibodies that can cause **hemolytic anemia in the fetus** if she has a second pregnancy (1st pregnancy is usually not an issue). *If hemolysis is mild, increased red cell production may suffice to maintain near-normal levels of red cells. However, with more severe hemolysis, progressive anaemia develops and may result in **hypoxic injury to the heart and liver**. Because of liver injury, plasma protein synthesis decreases, and levels of these proteins may drop to as low as 2 to 2.5 mg/ dL. Cardiac hypoxia may lead to cardiac failure. The combination of reduced plasma oncotic pressure and increased hydrostatic pressure in the circulation (secondary to cardiac failure) results in generalized edema, culminating in **hydrops fetalis*** *Both the foetus and placenta are pale.* *Liver and spleen are enlarged.* *The bone marrow demonstrates compensatory hyperplasia of Erythroid.* *Extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes...* *Presence in the peripheral circulation of large numbers of immature red cells, including reticulocytes and erythroblasts (erythroblastosis fetalis).* *Jaundice develops since hemolysis causes the release in blood of unconjugated bilirubin, which can pass through the infant’s poorly developed BBB. Being water-insoluble, bilirubin binds to lipids in the brain and, since the brain is the organ with the highest amount of cholesterol, the presence of bilirubin can damage the CNS, causing kernicterus. The brain is enlarged and edematous and, when sectioned, has a bright yellow colour, particularly the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, cerebral grey matter and spinal cord.* Today immunological procedures available prevent antibody formation.\n\n**how can we differentiate between the possible causes of microcytic**\nanemia? beta thalassemia differs from iron deficiency anemia in the following: it shows abnormal Hb structure on electrophoresis Hb and MVC were never normal in any of the CBC in patient’s life family history: genetic condition that manifests in both homozygous and heterozygous, although the latter present less signs. in the homozygous, there are physical indications: hypertrophy of the maxilla exposed upper teeth periorbital puffiness low nasal bridge bossing of the skull iron deficiency will present: glossitis, cheilitis, koilonychia, dry skin and hair ice craving PICA IRON values are low in lab! (iron is normal in beta thalassemia)\n\n**what are the normal iron values in lab? which ones do we use to prove**\niron deficiency? Normal reference ranges are: TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity)= serum transferrin: 240–450 µg/dL Transferrin saturation: 20–50% Serum iron: Men: 65 to 176 µg/dL Women: 50 to 170 µg/dL Serum Ferritin: 30 - 300 µg/L for males, 30–160 µg/L for females.\n\n**IRON DEFICIENCY:**\nTIBC or Serum Transferrin: HIGH Transferrin Saturation (iron/TIBC x 100): LOW (<15%) Serum Ferritin: LOW (<30) N.B.: ferritin levels measured usually have a direct correlation with the total amount of iron stored in the body. However, ferritin levels may be artificially high in cases of anemia of chronic disease, where ferritin is elevated in its capacity as an inflammatory acute phase protein and not as a marker for iron overload\n\n**what are the clinical signs of hemolytic anemia?**\nHemolytic anemia is caused by destruction of RBCs in circulation. It may be an acute problem but frequently is a chronic or repeated problems and signs include: jaundice enlarged spleen: recognizable with abdominal palpation or imaging tests (splenectomy can become necessary) hemoglobinuria: dark urine due to free Hb in the urine\n\n**mention the main possibilities there are in the case of a patient**\npresenting with normocytic anemia with low reticulocytes: Bone marrow disorders which lead to a decrease in rate of production of NORMAL blood cells. To confirm or reject this hypothesis it is important to conduct a bone marrow biopsy. Low levels of EPO, due to conditions such as renal failure. low androgens low thyroid hormones chronic inflammation\n\n**what is the workflow of diagnosis in case normocytic anemia is**\nsuspected? 1. If a patient appears anemic and has low Hb concentration on CBC with normal MCV, the first thing to rule out (time-sensitive) is if there is an ongoing hemorrhage or has been a recent hemorrhage check vital signs is patient taking anticoagulants? family history: does the patient have any genetic clotting disorder such as hemophilia? look for signs of clotting disorders: petechiae, purpura. 2. if answer is no 1. we still look for signs of loss of volume: tachycardia, dyspnea, hypotension as the bleeding could be internal. 2. We also look for signs of loss of Hb in absence of loss of volume. If internal bleeding is slow enough, volume lost is progressively replaced with water, thus maintaining volume but lowering Hb concentration by diluting it 3. if patient is hemodynamically stable, we proceed with a 3. reticulocyte count to understand if there is low RBC production or high RBC destruction: too many reticulocytes are indicative of a compensation due to recent blood loss (more than 24h ago), the possibilities are hemorrhage or hemolysis check for hemolysis signs during physical examination: jaundice, splenomegaly. Lab: elevated LDH and bilirubin, low haptoglobin. internal hemorrhage can be checked with imaging. FOBT and endoscopy for GIT bleeding . too little reticulocytes are indicative of : bone marrow malfunction: this can be due to chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, heart failure: cytokines can decrease RBC production. chronic renal failure → low EPO production ■ check creatine clearance (kidney function), thyroid hormone, androgens, CRP.\n\n**if the possibility of hemorrhage is discarded and the reticulocyte count**\nis elevated, how can we check for peripheral hemolysis? take family history and check for genetic disorders that may cause chronic or frequent hemolytic crises does the patient present splenomegaly? hemoglobinuria? check for autoantibodies against RBC did patient had heart surgery with mechanical valve insertion? (RBC passing through the valve could break)\n\n**symptoms of severe anemia**\nshortness of breath (dyspnea) palpitations increased heart rate maybe systolic murmur due to thrombotic turbulence due to tachycardia (disappears at rest)\n\n**what is considered mild anemia?**\nHb around 12g/dL\n\n**Symptoms of mild anemia?**\nasymptomatic, especially at rest symptoms (if present) are mild fatigue, asthenia intolerance to cold headache.\n\n**what is the prognosis of anemia?**\nprognosis will depend on the cause of the anemia and on the presence or absence of other pre-existing conditions that can aggravate the clinical picture such as respiratory insufficiency (even less O2) heart problems (increase in heart work)\n\n**Quick onset of anemic state has a greater danger**\n\n**what are the main signs of anemia during physical examination?**\npaleness of the skin and mucosa due to low Hb concentration and to peripheral vasoconstriction elevated HR possible hypotension (if there’s loss of volume) possible systolic murmur possible chest pain (myocardial ischemia)\n\n**are there any clinical signs that can help distinguish between types of**\nanemia? iron or vitamin 12 deficiency anemia present particular signs: glossitis (tongue inflammation) angular cheilitis (erosion at the corners of the mouth) koilonychia (concave nais) craving for ice or PICA (iron deficiency)\n\n**hemolytic anemia:**\njaundice enlarged spleen\n\n**what are important questions to ask in order to identify the origin of**\nthe anemic state? Is the patient bleeding (now)? Are there things to do immediately? How are vital parameters? Is blood pressure normal? Has the patient been bleeding (chronically or in the past)? If so, why? Is there evidence for increased RBCs destruction (either intravascular or extravascular)? Is the bone marrow suppressed? If so, why? Is the patient iron deficient? If so, why? Is the patient deficient in folate or vitamin B12? If so, why? Are there other conditions that include an abnormal oxygen delivery to tissues?\n\n**how can be the hypothesis of anemia be confirmed with lab/imaging?**\n1. confirm hypothesis with a complete blood count (CBC) 2. reticulocyte count can help assess how the bone marrow is functioning Bone marrow response takes a few days (4/10) to be evident: low reticulocyte count = issue in the bone marrow high reticulocyte count = bone marrow is trying to compensate for loss of RBCs. Loss of RBC can mean destruction (hemolytic anemia) or loss (hemorrhage). Differential: to check for hemolytic anemia look for: splenomegaly, hemoglobinuria and jaundice. hemorrhage may be recent (ask if there was bleeding at least 48h before), may be internal: vital signs → very low BP. ■ Chronic bleeding would result in iron loss, and if iron level is low this leads to an impaired bone marrow response resulting in the production of a lot of reticulocytes. Iron deficiency will show up as microcytic anemia, whereas hemolytic and hemorrhage will be normocytic.\n\n**If the hypothesis is a gastro-intestinal bleeding, how to prove/disprove**\nit? Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): confirmatory test, has to be repeated several times. Also, for bleeding to be GI dependent it must be constant, and not intermittent. If FOBT is positive we have to run other tests and examinations to find the source of the bleeding via: rectal examination or endoscopy (gastroscopy or colonoscopy).\n\n**what are observable signs of chronic alcohol abuse?**\njaundice spider angiomata palmar erythema ascites gynecomastia\n\n**if there’s liver disease, the following findings are also common:**\nsplenomegaly which will lead to thrombocytopenia with the appearance of petechiae which can fuse to form purpura.\n\n**if the hypothesis is that the anemic state of the patient is caused by a**\nvitamin b12 deficiency, how can you confirm it? Measure cobalamin and folate blood levels reticulocyte count should not be too elevated (bc it would make MCV value higher) there should be mild leukopenia and mild thrombocytopenia Check for increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin if defective, fragile RBC are produced then there can be hemolysis intravascularly and the cell contents (including LDH and bilirubin) would appear in the serum.\n\n**if the hypothesis is that the anemic state of the patient is caused by a**\nbone marrow disease, how can you confirm it? bone marrow biopsy\n\n**How do cytokines reduce RBC production?**\nInflammatory cytokines, especially IL-β and TNF-⍺ inducing apoptosis of RBC precursors down regulation of EPO receptors on progenitor cells. decrease EPO expression by renal cells. reduce iron absorption in the GI tract. Yet, macrophages can absorb it themselves: the patient will present high ferritin levels in the case of a chronic inflammatory condition even if present an iron deficiency. This is the reason why iron deficiency cannot be checked only by looking for evidence of lack of ferritin.\n\n**concept map**\n\n****\n\n****"}

Output only the summary in markdown.\n\n31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 DYSLIPIDEMIA Today we will talk about dyslipidemias, plural because there are several conditions that can determine the onset of different types of dyslipidaemia When we talk about dyslipidemia we intend high ratio in lipid composition in blood, in particular cholesterol, triglycerides, or both cholesterol and triglycerides, and these conditions are recognised to be a risk for cardiovascular diseases, in particular high cholesterol levels in the blood, named high cholesterolemia. Remember that high cholesterolemia is an autosomic disorder. High cholesterolemia means increased levels of cholesterol in the blood, but we know that lipids in general cannot flow freely in the blood, they need proteins to be carried in the blood from the liver to the peripheral tissues and vice versa from the peripheral tissues to liver. Cholesterol is the main component of the low density lipoproteins (LDL). For hypercholesterolemia, we can say that there is an increase of LDL in the blood. We can have higher cholesterolemia for different reasons: -excessive introduction of cholesterol in the diet -when there is an increase in endogenous synthesis of cholesterol -altered uptake of cholesterol from the liver, so the LDL remains in the blood. STRUCTUREOFOXIDIZEDLDL This is the structure of LDL present in the blood, it is a rounded structure, made of different lipids in the different layers (fig.1): -in the external layer, we have phospholipids and free cholesterol, the more hydrophilic lipids -centrally, in the core of the lipoprotein we have esterified cholesterol and triglycerides -All around this sphere we have big proteins called apolipoproteins B100, specific lipoproteins of LDL and this is Fig.1 important because they are specifically recognised by LDL receptors that are present in the liver and in the peripheral tissues, so thanks to the apolipoproteins B 100 LDL are recognised and internalized by the liver and by the peripheral tissues. LDL can cause atheroma formation, Professor Leonarduzzi will explain specifically this theme. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects only big and medium arteries, the arterial wall of these arteries. FORMATIONOFATHEROMA You can see here in fig.2 LDL in the blood connected to the presence of endothelial dysfunctions is the triggered for the development of atherosclerosis. They enter in the intima layer of the arterial wall at they are oxidized that means that the main lipids that compose LDL are oxidized. Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 68 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 Phospholipids are oxidized, also cholesterol esters and apoproteins b100 are oxidized. Fig.2 So oxidized (modified) LDL are produced in the intima of these arteries and these oxidized LDL are strongly atherogenic. In fact normal LDL are not atherogenic, they become atherogenic when they become oxidized, and so they start to promote different events that lead to the formation of atheroma (atherosclerosis plaque) that grows inside the wall and arrives to occlude the arterial lumen. Oxidized LDL stimulate the differentiation of monocyte into macrophages , typical players of chronic inflammatory disease, that is also present in the atherosclerosis. They are attracted in the these walls and then they differentiate in macrophages and grab to specific receptors that recognised only oxidized LDL that in this way can be bound on their surfaces and they are internalized by macrophages. By these moment macrophages are called pom cells in italian cellule schiumose, and these cells start to accumulate creating the central part of the atheroma, a lipidic and necrotic core because in the central part there is the lack of nutrients and oxygen. Simultaneously the smooth muscle cells of the vessels start proliferating and migrate in the intima around the necrotic core and differentiate in myofibroblasts, cells similar to fibroblasts so they are able to produce extracellular matrix, the fibre scar is created around the central lipidic core. This plaques grows and can cause the rupture of the plaque creating a thrombus and blood flows is stopped, the artery is occluded and happens an ischemic necrosis because the tissue do not receive any more nutrients and oxygen. Oxidized LDL accumulated in the arterial wall stimulates : -recruitment of monocytes from the blood -the differentiation of monocytes in macrophages -the proliferation, differentiation and migration of muscle cells All these events are strongly stimulated by the oxidized LDL Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 69 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 WHATAREINSTEADHDL? HDL are high density lipoproteins, they carry cholesterol, also called good cholesterol because transport the cholesterol from the periphery and transport it to the liver. So higher level of LDL are atherogenic, higher level of HDL are considered anti atherogenic, because they remove cholesterol. HDLANDLDL You can see in the picture (fig.3) the composition of LDL on the left and that of HDL on the right Fig.3 They are called respectively bad and good just depending on the direction in which they transport the cholesterol. LDL-->produced in the liver and brings cholesterol from the liver to the periphery HDL-->flows in the opposite direction they take from periphery to the liver when it is recycled LDL are bigger than HDL and they have a lower density, that's why they are called low density lipoproteins while HDL are called high density lipoproteins, they are smaller. Higher is the density smaller is their sizes and the density mainly depends on the quantity of proteins, LDL have only one apolipoprotein that is apo B100. LDL are also called LDL cholesterol but is not formed only by cholesterol, but cholesterol is the main component, it is the 50% of LDL. Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 70 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 CLASSESOFLIPOPROTEINS These are the principle classes of lipoproteins, 4 categories(fig.4): Fig.4 2)Then we have VLDL, very low density lipoproteins, also in this case triglycerides are the main components and they have low level of cholesterol, of proteins and phospholipid 3)Then there are the LDL main component is cholesterol, 50% and there is an higher presence of protein respect the previous ones 1)Chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins, they are the lipoproteins with the lower density and the main components are triglycerides. In chylomicrons protein components is very low so the density is very low too. 4)HDL very high quantity of proteins of their surface this is why density of them is so high. With electrophoretic division(fig.5) lipoproteins that are bigger and have lower density stays here in the higher part and the smaller and with higher density go lower part, in this way we can divide and recognize them. But it is not just the density Fig.5 that leads to this kind of division, in fact very low density you can see that are higher than LDL and HDL. This is due to their charge because migration is affected by the density, but also by the charge of the particles and VLDL have higher presence of negative charges due to the presence of proteins on their surface. CHARACTERISTICSANDDIMENSIONSOFLIPOPROTEINS Here(fig.6) we can see the characteristics of the different lipoproteins. Professor has put this slide in order to focus and memorise lipoproteins and their dimension, remembering that chylomicrons are the biggest ones and HDL are the smallest lipoproteins. LIPOPROTEINSCOMPOSITION We have already seen the composition of LDL, and they are composed all in a similar way. The internal part is called core, and contains the more hydrophobic portion mainly esterified cholesterol and triglycerides The external part contains more hydrophilic which are non esterified cholesterol, phospholipids and proteins that are exposed. In this way lipoproteins can flow in the blood, exposing a hydrophilic portion, without forming a lipidic embolism. So, thanks to these particular proteins all around we can avoid this situation. Fig.6 Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 71 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 LIPOPROTEINSFUNCTIONS absorption of cholesterol, long fatty acids, fat soluble vitamins from the diet transport of triglycerides, cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins from the liver to the peripheral tissue where they are needed and vice versa transport form the periphery when there is an excess of cholesterol and it is transported to liver where it is recycled APOLIPROTEINS All lipoproteins are surrounded by apolipoproteins of which the main work is to allow the assembly of lipids, allow lipids to flow in the blood and they are important because they activate the enzymes, so the specific metabolism, key enzymes in lipid metabolism which is lipoprotein lipase that activate a specific lipoprotein and are the ligands for receptors that specifically recognize them in peripheral tissues and in the liver.(fig.7) It is not necessary to remember them all, but remember ApoB- 100 that is the specific apolipoprotein of the LDL ApoC-II is important for different lipoproteins and Fig.7 is the apolipoprotein that activates the lipases enzymes apoA-I and II are the main apolipoproteins of HDL (mainly apoA-II) EVALUATIONOFTHELIPIDPROFILE These are the values that have to be considered in order to understand if there is dyslipidemia or high risk of cardiovascular problems, because higher level of LDL are considered a possible risk , because they are risk factors for atherosclerosis(fig.8) Values in subjects that have no other risk factors for atherosclerosis, so healthy subjects, so no familiarity for cardiovascular events, with health lifestyle and LDL concentration is optimal if it is minor than 100 mg/100 ml On the opposite HDL is very good when there is an higher level. Fig.8 Higher triglycerides are not considered risk conditions for cardiovascular problems, but are more related to problems of the liver as steatosis. Remember that risk factors for atherosclerosis are many, not only hypercholesterolemia: diabetes, smoke, hypertension, obesity, age. They are all risk factors. Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 72 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 Based on the quantities of risk factors that the person has a score of risk is attributed. If the LDL is higher and the person has other risk factors can be taken into consideration the possibility of assumption of some drugs in order to reduce the synthesis of cholesterol by the liver and reduce blood cholesterol. Also is very important secondary prevention that means treatment for people that have already had cardiovascular events, in that case the better to control the value of LDL around 55 mg/dL. Statins or others drugs can reduce drastically the LDL in the blood. But lowering so much the LDL level in the blood is also dangerous because cholesterol is one of the main molecules for the life of our cells, is one of the main components of the plasma membrane, for the synthesis of steroid hormones etc.(fig.9) Fig.9 LIPOPROTEINMETABOLISM We can divide the metabolism of the lipoproteins in two: exogenous cycle: absorption and transport of lipids from the diet endogenous cycle: transport of lipids from the liver to the peripheral tissues and vice versa With the picture is easier to understand(fig.10). EXOGENOUSCYCLE Lipids are absorbed from the diet and the first lipoproteins that are created are chylomicrons, the one with lower density, that contains cholesterol and triglycerides. At the level of skeletal muscles, heart and adipose tissues there is an enzyme that is called lipoprotein lipase that removes triglycerides from the chylomicrons and these triglycerides are used by muscles for energy and they are captured by adipose tissue for deposit. By these way Fig.10 chylomicrons become residual chylomicrons or also remnants. Remnants are bounded to hepatocytes in the liver, cholesterol and the other compounds of chylomicrons are kept by hepatocytes and by they are recycled. What happens in the liver? Now the ENDOGENOUS CYCLE starts Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 73 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 Fig.11 The liver produces VLDL the first lipoproteins assembled by the liver are very low lipoproteins and they are rich in triglycerides and again when they are close to muscles and adipose tissue the lipoprotein lipase eliminated triglycerides from VLDL and VLDL are transported in LDL, that are rich in cholesterol and poorer in triglycerides. Then some LDL are captured again by the liver because in the surface of hepatocytes we have LDL receptors that specifically recognize apo B 100, that is the apolipoprotein present on the surface of the LDL, so they are kept. But LDL also go in the periphery to give cholesterol to our peripheral tissues and on the cells of the peripheral tissues LDL find the same LDL receptor recognizing the apo B100. HDL take cholesterol from the peripheral tissue and bring to the liver with the opposite transport LDL receptor and lDL particle: the apo B100 is apolipoprotein of LDL specifically recognised by the LDL receptors (fig.11). LDL are internalized by cells of the liver or other cells as that of the peripheral tissues. The receptors is recycled and re-exposed again on the surface while LDL is broken up Proteins in amino acids Cholesterol in lipids that can be used by the cells to do synthesis of hormones, for the reparation or turnover of the cell membrane etc.. Extra cholesterol is stored as cholesterol esters and the presence of extra cholesterol goes to act in a negative feedback way, meaning that if you have more extra cholesterol this will slow down the processes of synthesis of cholesterol of new cholesterol by the cells. So the extra cholesterol will inhibit the enzymes responsible for cholesterol synthesis that is hydroxyl-methyl-glutaril-CoA reductase At the same time extra cholesterol goes to inhibit also the synthesis by cells of new LDL receptors, by this way LDL receptors are recycled by the cells but not anymore produced, in this way is less absorbed. These are the two main proteins that favour the exit of Cholesterol from the lysosomes: Human pick c1 and human pick c2 There is a disorder of the human pick: the children’s Alzheimer’s disease, due to the accumulation of cholesterol in our tissues. Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 74 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 This is the exogenous cycle, (fig.12) so the absorption of lipids from the Fig.12 diet, as i told you before lipoproteins that are assembled are chylomicrons that have two main apolipoprotein which are: apo B 48-->already present assembled in the intestinal mucosa apo C II-->acquired in the blood thanks to HDL that donate this apoC 2 to the chylomicrons. Is an important apolipoprotein because is a cofactor of the lipoprotein lipase enzyme, activating it. This enzyme is present in the capillary wall of the skeletal muscles, heart and adipose tissue and it is important to remove fatty acids, triglycerides from chylomicrons and by this way chylomicrons loose triglycerides, phospholipids , together with cholesterol are used to make VLDL and the particles produced are called residual chylomicrons. Residual chylomicron acquire from HDL also apoE that is another apolipoprotein that is important because is recognized again by another receptor in the hepatocytes and so they are used by hepatocytes to assemble the VLDL and endogenous pathways in the adipose part. This is the endogenous cycle (fig.13), the liver synthesizes triglycerides, cholesterol and are released in the blood the VLDL, the very low density lipoproteins, that when are in proximity of skeletal muscles or adipose tissue find on the capillary wall the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. This enzyme is activated by apo cII Fig.13 that is present also on the LDL and is the same apoprotein present on the surface of chylomicrons. So apo cII is a cofactor of the activator of the lipoprotein lipase and so the triglycerides are extruded by VLDL and used by skeletal muscles or stored in adipose tissue and IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein) are produced. 50% of IDL goes back to the liver to be recycled and are recognised by the receptors that recognize apo B100 The other 50% are again metabolized by the lipoprotein lipase and transformed in LDL, losing the residual triglycerides, increasing the ratio of cholesterol (fig.14). Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 75 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 70% of LDL goes back to the liver and are recognized by LDL receptors and if there is mutation at level of these LDL receptor it can be a big problem because it is not anymore recognized by the hepatocytes and remains at circulation level. This is the main cause of familiar hypercholesterolemia. 30% goes to peripheral tissues where they find same receptors of that of the liver. Hypercholesterolemia is the main risk factor for atherosclerosis , but also for Alzheimer’s disease or stroke. It’s less known that hypercholesterolemia is also cause for the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer’s disease because this situation alters the composition of the blood brain barrier. Red circle in fig.15 are the Fig.14 positions in which cholesterol is prone to be oxidized. As I told you before the cholesterol per se, so the native cholesterol, is not atherogenic, it's not bad, but it becomes bad or atherogenic when it is oxidized. We find oxidized cholesterol in LDL, that is very atherogenic and the oxidation of cholesterol in different parts give rise to the production of the so called oxysterols or cholesterol ester oxidation products. There are a lot of oxysterols (fig.16): 24 and 27 HYDROXYCHOLESTEROL come from the enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol, there are enzymes that specifically oxidize cholesterol in a specific part. For example: Fig.15 Cholesterol 27hydroxilates is the enzyme that oxidize cholesterol in position 27 Fig.16 Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi Cholesterol 24 hydroxilates is the enzyme that oxidizes cholesterol in the position 24 Other oxysterols otherwise are produced not because of activity of an enzyme but because of the presence of reactive oxygen species, so they are oxysterols by autoxidation, in the presence of oxidative stress and inflammation, in which we have several oxygen species, and so in this way cholesterol is oxidized. 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 Oxysterols can be assumed from the diet in particular by fat rich food exposed to heat, light, refrigeration... A food that is very rich in oxysterol is grilled cheese, meat on barbecue etc. Endogenous sources of oxysterols can be: non enzymatic, so formed by reactive oxidative stress and inflammation enzymatic, because of the activity of enzymes that go to oxidize cholesterol in specific parts creating oxysterols This is again a picture (fig.17) showing the atherogenic process, the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. LDL in the blood present at higher concentration enter the medium and large arteries and are oxidized and when they are oxidized they are atherogenic. Inside the oxidized LDL we find oxidized cholesterol. Oxidized LDL are taken up by macrophages and then oxysterols in the intima had been demonstrated to modulate all the phases of Fig.17 atherogenesis: they are able to favour the recruitment of monocytes from the blood, so oxysterols signal to the healthy cells to produce chemoattractant proteins mcp1 that attract monocyte from the circulation to the site of inflammation. they favour the transmigration of monocyte they favour their differentiation into macrophages stimulate smooth muscle cells of vessels to proliferate and migrate and to differentiate and so on so they are very dangerous when they are in the intima. In higher level of LDL oxidized we find more oxysterols. Oxysterols are involved also in other diseases. Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 77 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 CHOLESTEROLMETABOLISMINBRAIN Brain is the organ with the higher concentration of cholesterol. And cholesterol in the brain doesn't count from the diet or from the liver, the brain synthesizes it's own cholesterol and is synthesized by the astrocytes (fig.18). Astrocyte starts from acetil CoA and from all the enzymes of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, synthesizes cholesterol because cholesterol cannot cross the blood brain Fig.18 barrier because of its structure, so it cannot pass neither from the peripheral tissues to the brain neither from the brain to the peripheral tissues. So astrocytes synthesize cholesterol esters that is then extruded by astrocytes through abc binding that are transporters on the surface and cholesterol is bound to apolipoprotein E to create lipoprotein similar to HDL. By this way lipoprotein carry cholesterol to the neurons, since neurons need it for membrane repair myelin synthesis synaptogenesis How cholesterol can be eliminated by the brain? Cholesterol to be eliminated by the brain has to be oxidized. So, the formation of oxysterols is essential for extra cholesterol to be eliminated and not to be accumulated too much in neurons. In particular neurons have this enzyme that is c46a1 that is 24 hydroxides, so it's an enzyme that oxidase cholesterol in position 24 and in this way cholesterol can exit the neurons. Hypercholesterolemia in blood, so high level of LDL brings to the blood brain barrier dysfunction leading to the passage of big amounts of oxysterols in the brain and the accumulation of oxysterols is a factor that favour the onset of neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer’s disease. And as the Alzheimer’s disease progresses with time and in late advanced stage oxysterols are increased so much that they are worsening the situation. Remember that brain is a particular organ in which cholesterol is synthesized and has a metabolism different from that of the liver. Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 78 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 ALZHEIMER’SDISEASE Alzheimer’s disease it is a neurodegenerative condition, degeneration means that there is the accumulation in cells of materials that should not be there and brings to the necrosis and inflammation in the tissue. It is characterized by the of amyloid plaques by made amyloid that is a neurotoxic (fig.19). presence contributes damage and necrosis So, protein beta this to Fig.19 presence in the extracellular space of the cerebral cortex (because only the cerebral cortex is affected in Alzheimer’s disease) of the neurons and all cells of the cerebral cortex. Together with the amyloid plaques there is another characteristic that is the nft inside neuros, the neurofibrillar tangles, made of tau protein that is hyperphosphorilated and aggregates in the intracellular portion of the neurons causing their death. It is still debated if the amyloid plaques or nft come first, who is the main toxic compounds that lead to death of neurons. Until now literature was focus on amyloid plaques, so a lot of drugs have been developed against them but they weren't working so good. Now we are focusing on nft. The answer is that there are multifactorial causes that cause this disease and until now there isn't a drug that is working good. But there are drugs that counteract already formed toxic compounds, but they are not able to prevent new formation. GENETIC CONDITIONS AND DYSLIPIDEMIA These (fig.20) are the genetic conditions that bring to different types of dipyslipidemias MONOGENIC PRIMARY DYSLIPIDEMIA There are a lot of monogenic dyslipidemias, meaning that only one Fig.20 gene is mutated, so only one protein essential for lipid metabolism doesn't work, or isn't present, bringing to development of dyslipidemia, but usually the common cases of dyslipidemia are polygenic. This box is on the dyslipidemia characterized by alteration of LDL cholesterol levels because there are also dyslipidemias characterized by alteration of HDL. LDL increased LDL Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 79 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 1)familial hypercholesterolemia, autosomal dominant due to deficit of LDL receptors. We have seen that receptors presence is crucial on the surface of the hepatocytes, so if they are not functioning or they aren't present the LDL remain in the blood causing an increase level. 2)familial apolipoprotein B 100 defect If there is a monogenic defect , for example a mutation present on the gene encoding for the apo b 100, apo b 100 is not assembled in the right way and is not recognized by receptors and so LDL remain in the blood, causing hypercholesterolemia 3) autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia, again it is another familial hypercholesterolemia, is a recessive one, and depends on the fact that LDL receptors are not recycled in the right way and LDL do not find receptors on the surface and accumulate in blood 4) autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia Is another genetic condition due to the increase quantity of PCSK9, that is an important molecule that favours the recycling of LDL. If there is too much of this molecule, LDL receptors are recycled too much and are not on the surface and so the LDL remains in the blood. 5) sitosterolaemia Sitostirols are stirols of the oil in general and so are assumed from the diet and there are genetic conditions in which sitostirols remain in the blood and they compete with the LDL for LDL receptors and so LDL do not find their receptors and remain in the blood causing hypercholesterolemia But there are opposite conditions that are genetic in some population in which there are conditions that brings to a decrease of LDL in the blood and it's a protective condition against cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, etc... decrease of LDL One of them is due to the deficiency of PCSK9, a molecule that favour the recycling of LDL receptor. If there is the defieciency of this molecule the receptors remain on the surface in big amount acting on LDL, and so we have a decrease amount of LDL in the Fig.21 blood (fig.21). FAMILIALHYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA In general, you can speak of familial hypercholesterolemia because of deficit of apoB 100 LDL receptor or PCSK9, but the term familial hypercholesterolemia refers specifically to the autosomal dominant disorder due to problems related to LDL cholesterol. It’s dominant, so it’s a condition present also in heterozygous, but of course in homozygous condition the situation is much worse, leading to atherosclerosis already in paediatric age. A clinical manifestation of hypercholesterolemia are tendons xanthoma, that are accumulation of cholesterol in the skin, tendons, eyes (in the cornea, or in eye lid: is called xantelasma) Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 80 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 A defect of LDL receptor does not mean that LDL receptors are completely not present on the cell surface, it may happens, but this happens only if it isn’t not at all synthesized. If the LDL receptors are not synthesized you will not find any LDL receptor, also if it remains trapped in the Golgi or in endoplasmic reticulum, in this case is synthesized but is trapped and you cannot find them on the surface. But there are some cases in which you find LDL receptors on the surface, but they are not functioning, or they are not present in the right place , so they are different grades of severity of this disease. PCSK9 is the protein that binds to the LDL receptors and favours its uptake by the liver. Genetic conditions in which PCSK9 is too high, brings to increased LDL in the blood because the receptor is internalized too much and the LDL remain in the blood On the contrary, the loss of function of PCSK9 brings to a decrease in LDL receptors because the receptors remain on the surface and uptake better the LDL. Pcsk9 is very important because new drugs in the last years have been developed that target PCSK9. The main drugs that lower cholesterol are statins, that go to inhibit the hydroxyl methil… that synthesizes cholesterol, but there are people that do not tolerate statins, because statins have many collateral problems related to muscles, etc… So, for people that do not tolerate statins, during the last years, have been developed some antibodies against PCSK9, evolocumab. These antibodies go to bind PCSK9 and in this way PCSK99 do not favour the uptake and recycling of LDL receptor, and LDL receptors remain on the surface ready for the uptake of LDL. People that takes these drugs have very low cholesterol, because these drugs low cholesterol so much. MONOGENICPRIMITIVEDYSLIPIDEMIA Then there are monogenic primitive dyslipidemias due to alteration of HDL. There are conditions in which HDL are too high, in this case increased HDL protect from cardiovascular events, because extra cholesterol is transported to the liver. The increase of HDL cholesterol is mainly due to mutation at the gene coding for CITP cholesterol ester transfer protein , that is a protein that transfers cholesterol esters from HDL to VLDL and in turn HDL takes triglycerides, and these triglycerides are important for the HDL maturation and by this way HDL can be kept by the liver. At the same time there are disorders that cause a decrease in HDL, so decrease level of HDL are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, for example a disease, a defect in the transporter that takes cholesterol inside of cells, if it is not present cholesterol remains accumulated in the peripheral tissues. These in fig.22 are conditions that brings to the increase in triglycerides. We have seen that triglycerides are present in chylomicrons and VLDL , so the first one is a typical genetic dyslipidemia that Fig.22 brings to high triglycerides, In particular high chylomicrons, because there is the deficiency of lipoprotein lipases, the enzymes that that takes triglycerides from chylomicrons to form VLDL, and so triglycerides remain in chylomicrons. Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 81 31.03.2023 GAMBA L.6 Or it’s also possible to have apo C II deficiency , that is the apolipoprotein that activates lipoprotein lipase, and so this latter one cannot work and triglycerides are not used by the muscles nor stored in the adipose tissue and they remain in the chylomicrons. These in fig.23 are the ways to diagnose if in a person there is the presence of genetic familial hypercholesterolemia. There are scores that are given based if there is a family history, if patient has already connected events, the presence of tendinous xantoma, or accumulation of cholesterol in the cornea, also xanthelasma are that is evaluated, presence cholesterol in the eye lid. Also the Fig.23 level of LDL cholesterol are evaluated and the score is attributed also based on the analysis of genetic mutations. Evaluated mutations are LDL receptor, apo B 100 and PCSK9. The monogenic primary dyslipidemias are more cussed by polygenic mutations, this means that more genes causes this conditions. The more famous and frequent is familial combined hyperlipidaemia, that is characterized by polygenic mutations, so different genes, bringing to the increase by the liver of VLDL and of apo B 100. If apo b 100 is synthesized a lot, a lot of apo b 100 will be around LDL and LDL will be smaller because the dimension is inversely proportional to density, so if LDL have higher density they are smaller and these small dense LDL are very atherogenic, more than normal LDL. SECONDARYDYSLIPIDEMIA Condition of dyslipidemias in case of disorders like diabetes or some drugs that affect lipidic profile, as oestrogens and androgens that increases triglycerides and HDL Glucocorticoids increase triglycerides, causing steatosis Beta blockers and antipsychotic increase triglycerides Eleonora Giammarino, Erica Veronesi 82", "input": "", "output": "**what is dyslipidemia?**\nPathological conditions characterized by a permanent alteration of the plasma concentration of LDL, HDL or VLDL.\n\n**What is the general composition of a lipoprotein?**\nInternal portion «CORE» which contains varying concentrations of esterified cholesterol, TG. External portion that contains phospholipids, non-esterified cholesterol and proteins (exposing the hydrophilic portion)\n\n**what is the general function of lipoproteins?**\nthey carry lipids (phospholipids, cholesterol, triglycerides and fat-soluble vitamins), around the blood circulation where they are required.\n\n**what are the types of lipoproteins?**\nin general, lipoproteins are classified in terms of their densities. 1. Chylomicrons: The least dense and the largest. They contain Apolipoprotein B-48, Apo E and Apo C2, C1, A1, A2. they contain a high amount of triglycerides and are coated by a thin layer of proteins. they carry TG, small amounts of cholesterol and lipid-soluble vitamins from the enterocytes. 2. VLDL Made in the liver. Contain APO C2, APO B-100, Apo E. They carry high concentrations of triglycerides, lower conc. of cholesterol, and phospholipids. 3. IDL Contain APO C2, APO B-100, Apo E. They result from VLDL metabolism. They carry cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides from the liver LDL 4. Contain ApoB-100, Apo C2, Apo E. From the metabolism of IDL. Mainly contain cholesterol (40%), some phospholipids and very small amounts of TG. They contain more than 60% of blood cholesterol 70% of LDL go to the liver, 30% to periphery. HDL 5. Contain Apo A1, A2. Apo C2 and Apo E. Mainly contain proteins, cholesterol does not exceed 20%. 5. They transport phospholipids, cholesterol and triglycerides from the periphery to the liver. Some are generated in the liver, a small amount in the intestines. 6.\n\n**What are apolipoproteins?**\nApolipoproteins are the proteins that coat the lipoproteins. Their functions are: Structural: they create a hydrophilic coating for the lipid core and allow the assembly of the lipoprotein. Ligand for specific receptors they activate Lipoprotein Lipases\n\n**General evaluation of a lipid profile**\nTotal cholesterol: < 200 mg/dL. High is 260. LDL: <100. 160 is high. HDL: >40 Triglycerides: < 150. high > 200. Very high >500.\n\n**describe the exogenous cycle of lipoproteins**\n1. Fats in the lumen of the intestine are emulsified in micelles which are taken up by enterocytes, packaged into Chylomicrons (90% TG). 2. Chylomicrons enter the circulation and acquire other apoproteins, in particular apoCII (cofactor of lipoprotein lipase, LPL), and apoE from HDL; excess cholesterol, phospholipids and apolipoproteins are transferred to HDL. 3. Chylomicrons encounter Lipoprotein Lipases on the surface of adipose cells and striated muscle. The Apo CII receptor on chylomicrons activate this enzyme that converts TG → FFAs that enter the adipocyte. 4. The remaining protein and lipid part constitutes the \"remnants\" (residual chylomicrons) which are taken up by the hepatocytes via the apoE receptor: proteins are hydrolysed by lysosomal enzymes, TG are metabolised and cholesterol is excreted with the bile\n\n**describe the endogenous cycle of lipoproteins**\nThe liver synthesizes VLDL (richest in TG, less % cholesterol and phospholipids), which is hydrolyzed by Lipoprotein Lipases of peripheral tissues (Adipocytes and skeletal muscle interact with ApoC2) into IDL(decreased amount of TG). About half of these IDLs go back to the liver by interacting with the LDL receptor (that recognized both ApoB100 and ApoE). The remaining half are converted into LDL by hepatic Lipoprotein Lipases. LDL, which is rich in cholesterol, ****is taken up by the liver (70%) and endocrine cells for steroid hormone synthesis, and it is also taken up by vascular cells (ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, macrophages) where it is hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes into amino acids, esterified cholesterol and free cholesterol.\n\n****\n\n**what are oxysterols? what is their relevance in health**\nOxysterols are sterols derived from the oxidation of the cholesterol molecule They are obtained by oxidation reaction carried out by enzymes or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidized cholesterol becomes reactive and toxic to cells. In the subintima, LDL oxidation is one of the first triggers of atherogenesis (formation of atheroma). The first process involved in atherogenesis is the endothelial dysfunction caused in part by oxLDL In arteries, mmLDLs (minimally modified LDLs) are taken up by local macrophages, which become activated in response and start producing ROS, which oxidize LDL components. We can introduced oxysterols in the diet (autoxidation of food), but mainly they come from endogenous sources. Non enzymatic pathways Attack by reactive oxygen species 1. generated during inflammation 2. Enzymatic pathways cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) (mainly brain) cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) (various tissues) cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) (liver, prostate) cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (various tissues)\n\n****\n\n**what is the role of PCSK9?**\nPCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is an enzyme that binds to the LDL particle or to the LDL receptor and it impedes the recycling of the LDL receptor and instead drives its demolition within lysosomes (1 in 400 LDLr). The effect of PCSK9 enzymes is therefore reducing LDL absorption by the liver (by reducing the amount of LDLr), increasing plasma cholesterol. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new drug to treat hypercholesterolemia. Mainly used to treat familial hypercholesterolemia. Still very expensive and not widely used.\n\n**what are the monogenic primitive dyslipidemias that increase LDL cholesterol?**\nINCREASED LDL CHOLESTEROL: Familial Hypercholesterolemia Autosomal dominant. Caused by mutations in the gene that codes for LDL receptor (on liver) → High blood LDL. Heterozygotes (1: 500): elevated plasma cholesterol levels already at birth (average 350 mg / dL), tendon xanthomas before age 30, early atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease before age 40). In homozygotes (1: 1,000,000): rarely live past reproductive age. Plasma cholesterol around 600 to 1200 mg / dL, cutaneous and tendon xanthomas, coronary atherosclerosis, in pediatric age, myocardial infarction before 30 years. 150 types of LDLr mutations that can affect its synthesis in the ER (class I), transport to the Golgi or cell surface (class II), binding capacity (class III), clustering (class IV), and recycling (class V). Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB): is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of lipid metabolism associated with hyperlipidemia and elevated risk for atherosclerosis. FDB is caused by mutations in APOB reducing the binding affinity between apolipoprotein B-100 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH): very rare. Clinical phenotype similar to that of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) but is more variable, generally less severe, and more responsive to lipid-lowering therapy. Caused by a defect of some, but not all, cell types to mediate LDL receptor-dependent internalization of LDL and is caused by mutations in the gene for an adaptor protein called ARH. In affected cells, the LDL receptor gene is normal but LDL receptor protein accumulates at the cell surface because the ARH protein doesn’t have its normal capacity to interact with the receptor and trigger internalization. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (PCSK9 ↑) genetic increase of PCSK9 = increased destruction of LDLr. Sitosterolaemia: characterized by hyperabsorption of phytosterols due to loss of function mutation of ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes that code for ABC transporter proteins. These receptors normally pump back into the intestinal lumen the plant sterols that were previously internalized by NPC1L1 receptors, decreasing its absorption to less than 10%. Thus, mutation impairs this ability and the ability of the liver to preferentially excrete plant sterols into the bile. Sitosterol is very similar to cholesterol so it competes with LDL for LDLr binding, and these reults in decreased cholesterol absorption in the liver and therefore elevated blood cholesterol.\n\n**Decreased LDL cholesterol**\nAbetalipoproteinemia Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (ApoB mutations) PCSK9 deficiency\n\n**what are the monogenic primitive dyslipidemias that decrease LDL cholesterol?**\nABETALIPOPROTEINEMIA It is a very rare condition. In this case, APO B48 and APO B100 are deficient, almost completely lacking. it results in lipid malabsorption (chylomicrons), lowered amount of LDL in the blood circulation. Vitamin A deficiency may be observed. FAMILIAL HYPOBETALIPOPROTEINEMIA It consists in a moderate decrease of APO B (48 and 100) and is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. They have 130-140 mg of cholesterol per 100 ml. DEFICIT OF PCSK9 It is a rare, protective condition.\n\n**what are the monogenic primitive dyslipidemias that affect HDL cholesterol?**\nIncreased HDL: CETP Deficiency: it’s a very rare deficiency in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein. This protein exchanges triglycerides of VLDL against cholesteryl esters of HDL. As the result, VLDLs are processed to LDL. This TGs are readily hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipases, HDL molecules become smaller and easily taken up by the liver (maturation) If CETP is deficient, HDL remain full of TG and large, so the complete maturation is not possible and they remain in the bloodstream.\n\n**Decreased HDL:**\nApolipoprotein A1 deficiency HDL production (in liver and enterocytes) starts from APO A1 and lipids are introduced after though and ABC membrane transporter. In this condition there’s no APO A1 = no HDL production. Homozygotes are rare, more common are the heterozygotes. Tangier’s disease: the transporter ABCA1 that loads lipids inside HDL is not sufficient. There is no formation of HDL and cholesterol accumulates in the tissues. Yellow-colored accumulations of cholesterol in the mucosa of the throat is observed. LCAT deficiency (lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase) ****is generally found in HDL and carries out the esterification of cholesterol (transfer acyl group to free cholesterol. Cholesterol ester formation is necessary for the maturation of HDL, it changes the shape of the HDL, which becomes spherical. In the absence of LCAT, the HDL will never mature (sandwich/roundish shape) Immature HDL easily undergoes removal and demolition in the circulation.\n\n**what monogenic primary dyslipidemias result in increased triglycerides?**\nFamilial Chylomicronemia: LPL or APO CII deficiency resulting in impaired triglyceride download from lipoproteins into the cells. As a result there’s high blood triglycerides. When they’re really high (100 mg/ml) they increase blood viscosity (stasis), and may cause pancreatitis. APO A5 deficiency: very rare. APO A5 works more or less as APO C2. Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia : mutation in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) that results in having apo E2 isoform instead of E3. ApoE serves as a ligand for the liver receptor for chylomicrons, IDL and VLDL, also known as VLDL receptor. This defect prevents the normal metabolism of chylomicrons, IDL and VLDL, and leads to accumulation of cholesterol within scavenger cells (macrophages) to enhance development and acceleration of atherosclerosis. Hepatic lipase deficiency: very rare condition that results in hyperTG.\n\n**what are the polygenic primary dyslipidemias?**\nFamilial combined hyperlipidemia (↑ hepatic synthesis of VLDL and ApoB100, small-dense LDL). It is the most prevalent primary dyslipidemia. Autosomal dominant. Occurring in up to 1-3% of the general population, frequently remains undiagnosed and its precise definition is a subject of controversy. Characterized by fluctuations in serum lipid concentrations and may present as mixed hyperlipidemia, isolated hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or as a normal serum lipid profile in combination with abnormally elevated level of apolipoprotein B. High frequency of comorbidity with other metabolic conditions. Familial hypertriglyceridemia (↑ hepatic synthesis of VLDL) Familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (↓ HDL) accelerated catabolism of APO A1 → less production of HDL. Familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia (↑ HDL. Slower catabolism of APO A1, thus HDL is relatively higher in concentration.\n\n**what are the causes of secondary LDL hypercholesterolemia?**\n1. HYPOTHYROIDISM causes reduced catabolism of LDL → very high cholesterol. Triglycerides are not affected. 2. Nephrotic syndrome: low LDL catabolism, increased cholesterol. LIVER and cholestatic DISEASES In the case of biliary duct 3. obstruction, cholesterol remains in biliary canaliculi and may be taken up in the hepatocytes. Cholesterol is then reversed in the blood vessels. 4. ANOREXIA NERVOSA: low calorie intake, a low amount of energy is available for LDL catabolism → hypercholesterolemia.\n\n**what are the causes of secondary hypertriglyceridemia?**\n1. Alcohol consumption: Ethanol is a very strong stimulator of hepatic triglyceride synthase → synthesis of triglycerides is extremely amplified. 2. Type 2 Diabetes: The synthesis of lipids is favored (insulin 2. anabolic) and their catabolism is inhibited (insulin is anti-lipolytic). 3. Obesity 4. Pregnancy 5. SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus)\n\n**what are the causes of secondary HDL hypocholesterolemia?**\n1. smoking 2. type 2 diabetes 3. obesity\n\n**what are some notable effects of drugs and hormones on serum lipid levels?**\n\n****\n\n**How do statins and Ezetimibe work?**\nStatins work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, which is the rate- limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol. As a result, there is less cholesterol production from the liver, and hepatocytes respond by augmenting the amount of LDLr, both things result in less cholesterol circulating in the periphery. Ezetimibe works by targeting the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein on the brush border of the small intestine, which plays a key role in the absorption of cholesterol from the diet. By inhibiting NPC1L1, ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed from the intestine into the bloodstream. It is often used in combination with statins when statin therapy alone is not sufficient to reach target cholesterol levels."}

Output only the summary in markdown.\n\n21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 HEMOSTASIS Hemostasis is a physiological process that occurs when we have a lesion at the level of the vessel walls. It is a process activated at the site of vascular injury in order to form blood clots to prevent or limit the extent of bleeding hemorrhage. You know that the blood is liquid and the blood cells run in the middle of the vessel (erythrocytes in the middle and leukocytes more laterally, but they never touch or adhere to a normal endothelium). When there is a lesion in the vessel wall the blood assumes a semisolid or gelatinous consistency forming the so-called blood clot which is fundamental to stop the bleeding. It is a complex process and it involves injured blood vessels and different types of blood cells: platelets, ECs, SMCs, plasma and tissue proteins. The normal hemostasis mechanism involved different type of elements at the site of the vascular injury. We have platelets, extracellular and smooth muscle cells and different proteins. The 3 groups of tissue proteins involved are: 1.Procoagulant factors that promote blood clot formation at the site of the vessel injury and stop the leakage of blood. 2.Anticoagulant factors that act to stop or limit blood clot formation in the absence of a lesion on the vessel wall and control the formation of the clot. They prevent thrombosis. 3.Fibrinolytic factors are involved in dissolution and disgregation of the blood clot when the lesion has been repaired. Firstly, we need to repair the endothelium and when the lost endothelial cytes are replaced by new ones and the wall is repaired, the blood clot can be dissolved and this is due to the function of these factors. VASCULAR INJURY When a vascular injury, also called lesion, occurs there is immediately a vagal response that consists in vasoconstriction mediated by both a neurogenic reflex mechanism, and local release of factors such as endothelin secreted by endothelial cytes (powerful vasoconstrictor). The aim of vasoconstriction is to reduce the lesion and the quantity of blood that flows out of the vessel. bleeding will resume if not for platelet activation and coagulation factor, so this step is fundamental. Q: In which type of artery or veins does it happen? A: It happens everywhere in our body. Of course the hemorrhage will be severe if it involves important vessels. If I have a lesion at the level of the capillaries I will not have a big hemorrhage but a minor bleeding that stops immediately. Figure 1 Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 33 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 PLATELETS AGGREGATION AND ADHESION After the initial transient vasoconstriction we have the activation of platelets that start to adhere to endothelium and to each other. Platelets are disc-shaped anucleate cell fragments (deriving from megakaryocytes). In normal condition they never adhere to intact endothelium or aggregate to each other, they only start to adhere at the site of the lesion to close the hole. The function of these activated platelets depends on several specific glycoprotein receptors, and also on their capacity of contraction of the cytoskeleton. They are fundamental in this process since they release several factors present in two specific types of cytoplasmic granules: - α-granules: contain the proteins of coagulation cascade: fibrinogen, factor V, von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibronectin, PDGF, TGFb, adhesion molecules. The second type of granules are the dense, or δ-granules: we can find adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), calcium, serotonin, histamine and many other factors. During the activation of the platelets all the granule content will be released because each factor has an important rule in all the process. PRIMARY HAEMOSTASIS When there is a lesion of the vascular wall I lose endothelocytes and I have immediate exposition of highly thrombogenic constituents of the subendothelial connective tissue. So the subendothelial collagen is directly exposed to the blood and because of its thrombogenic properties, the platelets start to adhere at the site of the lesion and aggregate to each other to form the first platelet plug. This step is indicated as primary hemostasis (or primary platelet plug) that occludes the injured vessel and prevents blood to flow out. THE MECHANISM OF PLATELET AGGREGATION The adhesion of platelets is favored by the presence of the vWF which acts as an adhesion bridge between the exposed collagen and glycoprotein platelet receptors. It is basically the bridge between collagen and platelet. The aggregation of other platelets to each other is possible thanks to fibrinogen, which acts as a bridge between two receptor complexes on different platelets, composed of GpIIb-IIIa. When ATP that is present in dense granules is released, it can change the conformation of the receptor complex increasing the activity for fibrinogen. The deficiency of one receptor is responsible for disorders such as deficiency of von Willebrand disease. The patient suffering from these disorders will have troubles in the hemostasis process and in forming an appropriate blood clot. Figure 2 Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 34 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 When the platelets start to be activated they change their shape, from a smooth disc to a spiky “sea urchins”, that increase the surface area and contemporary there is also the release of granule contents. All these factors accumulated in the two types of granules will be released. Platelet activation is induced by the same factors that are released, including ADP and will stimulate platelet recruitment. Platelets will arrive at the site of the lesion, will be activated thanks to the factors present in the granules and will start to adhere and aggregate. In this step we have the release of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) that will further stimulate aggregation of the platelet itself. This step can be defined as additional platelet aggregation. At the beginning the initial wave of aggregation is reversible (with the activation of thrombin, the platelet plug will be irreversible), but later when there is the production of insoluble fibrin (necessary for stabilization of blood clot), this aggregation of platelets becomes irreversible. So at this point the primary clot will become irreversible. Figure 3 This picture (fig3) summarizes the primary hemostasis which results in the formation of the platelet plug. We have activation, recruitment and release of granules content. These factors stimulate adhesion and aggregation of platelets (vWF acts as a bridge between the principal receptor of platelet to sub endothelial collagen). So they bind the extra cell matrix exposed after the lesion, they change their shape. This is the formation of the first platelet plug. Q: I didn't get the action of fibrin, could you please explain it again? The professor explains again fibrinogen action: The fibrinogen that is present in the granules of the platelets is also one of the plasmatic proteins. It contributes to favoring the aggregation among other platelets, it can bind to a receptor complex present on the surface of the platelets (made by GpIIB and IIIA) and on the other side binds to another complex receptor present on a second platelet. It connects the two platelets promoting aggregation. So these receptors are ALWAYS present on the surface of platelets but can be modified by the release of these factors, to increase affinity and bind to fibrinogen, resulting in aggregation. COAGULATION CASCADE Immediately after the formation of the primary plug, only made of aggregated platelets, there is a coagulation cascade which consist in a series of amplifying enzymatic reactions which results in deposition of an insoluble fibrin clot, important to stabilize the plug. Only with the presence of fibrin the plaque is strong and at this point this plug is irreversible. It consist in a series of factor activation in which the first factor will activate the second one and so on. During platelet Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 35 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 activation it is important to activate the coagulation cascade because there is the translocation of negatively charged phospholipids on their surface. The presence of these phospholipids is important because phospholipids can act as a receptor for factor X, important for coagulation cascade, and will promote the assembly of coagulation factor complexes. We have 2 types of coagulation cascades: intrinsic and extrinsic pathways; the 2 pathways converge in the activation of factor X Calcium-dependent reactions. The intrinsic pathway is activated by factors that are only present in the blood. The first factor is Hageman’s factor, it is a starter of many cascades in inflammatory response. All these factors are present in the blood as precursors, so inactive. The activation of Hageman’s factor is possible thanks to activated platelets (because they are activated before the coagulation cascade) and plasma proteins. After activation of factor XII we have the activation of factor XI and so on, as you can see. The involvement of activated platelets contribute in the middle of cascade to favor bind of factor 5 and 10, even if this does not happen before the activation of the pathways. activation factor are only present in the blood. A clotting is initiated in laboratory by adding phospholipids calcium and wither a negative charged substances of a source of tissue factor. the red polypeptides ( in picture 4) are inactive factors, the dark green are active polypeptides while the light green one correspond to cofactors. The extrinsic coagulation cascade is activated by vascular damage and is induced by the release of a tissue factor, tissue thromboplastin (TF), which is not present in the blood and activated by vascular damage but is released by damaged tissue. Tissue thromboplastin is the starter of extrinsic coagulation cascade. in the end we have activation of prothrombin which lead to activation of thrombin, which is a fundamental protein which main activity is to activate transformation of fibrinogen ( soluble) to fibrin (insoluble). Figure 4 These two pathways converge in a bond that consists in the activation of factor X. In Both cases the result is the formation of fibrin, important for platelet plug. The insoluble fibrin is the result of fibrinogen conversion that in turn is catalyzed by thrombin. The thrombin arises from the precursor prothrombin and is important for the conversion of fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, important for the stabilization of primary platelet plug. Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 36 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 THROMBIN The thrombin is a fundamental enzyme in all the coagulation cascade because it has many functions which all lead to one main purpose: amplify the formation of blood clot. the functions are\n\n**Stimulate the activation of platelets by stimulating**\n\n**release of granules content**\n\n**recruitment of other platelets**\n\n**platelet contraction (contraction of cytoskeletal proteins, important for consolidation of**\ntheir aggregation)\n\n**Converts soluble fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that polymerize into an insoluble clot cementing**\nthe platelets. At this point we have the formation of a secondary definitive platelet plug or clot. It can happen that some red cells and leukocytes can be entrapped inside the clot (made of platelets and fibrin).\n\n**Stimulate the coagulation process by activating factor XI, but also V and VIII**\n\n**Stabilize the secondary platelet plug by activating factor XIII, which forms more solid covalent cross-**\nlinks between fibers of fibrin.\n\n**Stimulate clot contraction, important because during clot contraction, the serum is removed.**\n\n**Pro-inflammatory effects:**activates protease-activated receptors (PARs) expressed on inflammatory\ncells, endothelium, and other cells contributing to tissue repair and angiogenesis. After the stimulation of these receptors the inflammatory cells can release all the factors that are involved in the repair and angiogenesis process.\n\n**Anticoagulant effects:**it stimulates endothelial cytes to release factors such as NO and PGI2, with\nwhich the blood clot is composed. It is important to prevent the formation of the clot outside the site of injury. It can act as an anticoagulant preventing the clot from extending beyond the site of the vascular injury. Figure 5 Q: Those factors bind platelets or remain free in the blood? Because it can stimulate coagulation in other sites being free in the blood. A: no they don't because activated platelets are present only at the site of the injury. It is a local, not diffused event, otherwise it would be a pathological process, not a physiological one. The most important function of thrombin is that it favors the release of granules content of platelets, and converts fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, important for the stabilization of a clot. Thrombin can also stimulate inflammatory cells to release other important factors that are involved in the angiogenesis, these factors can stimulate the smooth muscle cells. release by ECs of factors that can control the formation of the blood clot, preventing the formation Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 37 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 of the clot outside the site of the lesion, such as NO and PGI2. Figure 6 secretion of the tissue plasminogen activator is important for the formation of plasmin, one of the most important for the dissolution of the clot. This factor is released to limit the clot only at the site of the lesion. From this picture we can summarize all the functions of thrombin, (the most important enzyme in the coagulation cascade, but also the hemostatic process). fig.6 SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS Figure 7 Now we have a CPI at the level of the secondary hemostasis with the secondary platelet plug, that is the definitive clot. So we have the coagulation cascade, intrinsic or extrinsic, with the final formation of the insoluble fibrin, important to stabilize the previous platelet plug, to obtain the secondary clot. This process can also be called cementing the clot. The clot is stable, we stop the blood from flowing out, then in 24 hours we should have the repair of the endothelium and the dissolution of the blood clot. To dissolve the clot we have the activation of the fibrinolysis through the enzymatic activity of plasmin. It has 2 functions: It limits clot size - - It contributes to dissolution of the blood clot The enzyme important for the dissolution of the blood clot is plasmin, we obtain it from the enzymatic hydrolysis of plasminogen, present in the action of various factors that are able to activate plasminogen and convert it into plasmin. plasmin breaks down fibrin, fibrinogen and some coagulation factors . The Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 38 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 plasminogen can be activated by factors present in the blood, such as Hageman factor or factorXIIa, and kallikrein deriving from the immediate vicinity of the clot. Other tissue factors that can activate it are released by microorganisms for example urokinase, streptokinase and staphylokinase. The most important plasminogen activator is tissue plasminogen activator, indicated with t-PA, as seen in the scheme it will lead to the activation of plasminogen. Figure 8 After plasminogen activation we have the formation of the plasmin which is able to digest fibrin and other factors that can be in touch with the clot such as fibrinogen and some coagulation factors, obtaining the dissolution of the clot. The action of plasmin must be controlled, in this case we have other factors that must regulate its action. There are some anticoagulant factors to prevent the formation of the clot outside the site of the injury. This process is the result of the balance of pro coagulation factors and anticoagulation factors and fibrinolytic factors. The clot must be formed only at the level of the injury so contemporary to its formation we have the release of a factor to limit the extension of the clot. In this case we have the release of plasmin that has to digest the blood clot and other factors are released to inhibit the excess action of plasmin. Factors that inhibit plasmin are alpha2-plasmin inhibitors that limit its action only where and when it is necessary. The last phase of the hemostasis is characterized by clot contraction to eliminate the liquid part, the serum. Then we have the activation of plasminogen through the release of intrinsic and extrinsic activation factors, mainly t-PA. There is also the release of some factors that prevent excessive coagulation such as a fibrinolytic product, and thrombomodulin. It is a real balance between all the factors of the three groups (coagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolytic factors). Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 39 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 Figure 9 We have ECs that can release t-PA and urokinase to activate plasminogen, that increases the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, that starts to digest fibrin and other coagulation factors that are in the blood. To avoid the excessive action of these activator factors of plasminogen, inhibitors such as PKI are released. On the other side we have free plasmin that must be controlled: if necessary plasmin can digest the blood clot but if it is overproduced, immediately it is blocked by specific inhibitors such as alpha2- plasmin that bind it to stop the functioning. ENDOTHELIUM The endothelium has a fundamental role in the hemostatic process, it regulates the formation, propagation and dissolution of the clot. It can control all the phases of the hemostatic process because it is important to regulate the balance between anticoagulant and procoagulant activities. Normal endothelium is a barrier, and it releases factors to inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation, for example NO and PGI2, ADP, when it is intact. Normal ECs express several factors that can also inhibit coagulation, for example thrombomodulin (inhibitor or regulator of coagulation cascade), endothelial protein C receptor, heparin-like molecules, they can also stimulate the release of tissue plasminogen activator. ECs can also regulate coagulation cascade by binding and altering activity of thrombin, a potent platelet activator. The normal endothelium has to fight against the formation of the clot. All anticoagulation and fibrinolytic factors act to prevent thrombosis and to prevent the formation of abnormal clots, when there isn’t any damage in the vascular clot. Eleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 40 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 Figure 10 When there is a lesion at the level of the endothelium, it loses all its antithrombogenic properties and at that point the platelets are able to form clots. From this picture (fig10) also we can see the function of the endothelium summarized. There are many factors which are antithrombogenic such as heparin-like molecules that stop and limit thrombin and the possibility to form clots when it is not necessary (because there is no lesion), or to release other coagulation factors as Prostaglandin 2, released to inhibit platelet aggregation. So the endothelium has an important function in the hemostatic process. DERANGED HEMOSTASIS,HEMORRHAGIC AND THROMBOTIC DISORDERS There are situations characterized by the alteration of the hemostatic process. The result is the appearance of hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorders. hemorrhagic disorders: alteration concerning the coagulation cascade and the coagulation factors thrombogenic events: increased action of the coagulation factors and anticoagulation factors. In case of hemorrhagic disorders characterized by excessive bleeding, we have some alteration in one of the steps of the hemostatic process. For example we have problems forming primary or secondary hemostatic plug, we are not able to stop blood flowing out, some of the clinical signs that can indicate an hemostatic disorder is the formation in the skin of petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses so skin hemorrhage. In case of thrombotic disorders we have the formation of blood clots without an injury at the level of the vascular wall so these clots can form everywhere. Thrombosis is an abnormal hemostatic process because the formation of the clot occurs without a lesion. CAUSES OF HEMORRHAGIC DISORDERS Some hemorrhagic disorders are dependent on vessel factors. They can be genetic or acquired diseases. There could be\n\n**Lack or insufficient constriction of the vasal lumen.**\nEleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 41 21.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.03 The first step is vasoconstriction and if this step is missing due to degenerative diseases at the level of the vessel wall (so in case of angiomatosis or hemastosis) there can be malformation of vessels or permanent dilation, resulting in the incapacity of SMCs to control vasoconstriction.\n\n**Altered functions of ECs.**\nThere are diseases characterized by deficiency of von Willebrand factors (important for adhesion of platelets, acting as a bridge between receptor and sub endothelial collagen Vessel wall component alterations (collagen, elastin, etc.)\n\n****\n\n**Alterations in SMCs and fibroblasts.**\nOther hemorrhagic disorders are due to platelet disorders. They can be genetic or acquired diseases. Caused by\n\n**Defects in platelet formation**\n\n**Reduced number of platelets is reduced due to a reduced number of precursors (megakaryocytes) 🡪 maturation defects or increased destruction.**\n\n**Increased number of platelets, in presence of plateletosis, characterized by myeloproliferative syndromes such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, myeloid metaplasia, etc.**\nOther Hemorrhagic disorders dependent on coagulation disorders. Can be either genetic or acquired diseases.\n\n**Hemophilia (genetic disorder)**\n\n**Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in factor VIII, but also the mutation of a few coagulation factors**\nhemophilia B is due to a deficiency of factor IX\n\n****\n\n**Deficiency of coagulation factor production in case of hepatic diseases. In the liver there is the synthesis of many coagulation factors, in case of hepatic diseases (cirrhosis or hepatitis) there is a deficiency in the synthesis of coagulation factors and a lack in the coagulation cascade**\n\n**Excessive destruction in case of disseminated intravascular proteolysis, or failed binding to receptors.**\nWe can have alterations in the coagulation control. For example\n\n**Diseases of the fibrinolytic system 🡪 components of the fibrinolytic system are plasminogen, plasminogen activators or inhibitors, inhibitors of plasminogen activators, specific plasmin inhibitors (𝛼2-antiplasnin, 𝛼2- macroglobulin).**\n\n**Genetic or acquired deficiency of plasmin inhibitors. In this case there is an excessive action of plasmin, excessive fibrinolysis with consequent hemorrhagic events, because fibrinolytic system is amplified as plasmin is not regulated by inhibitors of plasmin. As a consequence it works in an excessive way and the results are hemorrhagic manifestations.**\n\n**Antiprotease deficiency**\nRegarding the main antiproteases that control coagulation factors that are antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, antithrombin III, protein C and S, C1 inactivator, protein C inhibitors. All these factors regulate the formation of clots, especially antithrombin.\n\n**Genetic acquired deficiency of antithrombin III, the result is the presence of thrombotic events.**\nEleonora Deinite, Chiara Rosa 42", "input": "", "output": "Hemostasis\n\n**what is hemostasis?**\nhemostasis is the blood clotting process that prevents excessive hemorrhage after blood vessel damage.\n\n**describe the sequence of events leading to hemostasis at the site of vascular injury**\n1. Arteriolar vasoconstriction: is immediate and transient. Mediated by neurogenic reflex, and augmented by *endothelin *****(EC- secreted potent vasoconstrictor) and other similar factors. Primary hemostasis: formation of primary platelet plug. The 2. damaged endothelium exposes subendothelial collagen and Van Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelets bind via GpIb receptors to vWF on exposed ECM and are activated (shape change + granule content release). Platelets release secretory granules containing (among other things) ADP, and Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) that recruit additional platelets and induce platelet aggregation through platelet GpIIb-IIIa receptor binding to fibrinogen. 3. Secondary hemostasis: The exposed subendothelial cells (fibroblasts, SMCs) express a membrane-bound procoagulant glycoprotein, Tissue Factor, which activates Factor VII. Factor VII activation generates a coagulation cascade that culminates in the formation of Thrombin. Thrombin has two roles: it is a potent platelet activator, so it promotes additional platelet aggregation at the site of injury, and it also cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin. Fibrin creates a meshwork that stabilizes the clot. 4. Clot stabilization and resorption: the clot (platelets and polymerized fibrin) contracts to become a solid, permanent clot. At this point there is release from the regenerated endothelium of thrombomodulin that blocks the coagulation cascade, and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) that promote fibrinolysis and clot dissolution.\n\n**in general, what are the features of platelets that confer their functions?**\nPlatelets have several glycoprotein receptors a contractile cytoskeleton alpha granules containing adhesion molecule P-selectin on the membranes of the granules coagulation proteins including fibrinogen, coagulation factor V, and vWF. protein factors involved in wound healing: fibronectin, platelet factor 4, PDGF, TGF-beta. dense (delta) granules containing ADP ATP Ca++ serotonin epinephrine\n\n**what intrinsic properties of platelets allow platelet adhesion?**\ninteraction between membrane-bound Glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) in platelets with Von Willebrand factor in the subendothelium (that is in turn bound to collagen, so it acts as a bridge). Deficiency in Von Willebrand causes Von Willebrand disease. Deficiency in GpIb causes Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Both are bleeding disorders. direct binding to type I and IV collagen via Glycoprotein Ia / IIa complex (GpIa/IIa)\n\n**what allows platelet aggregation?**\nAggregation is accomplished by GpIIb-IIIa receptors on different platelets binding fibrinogen This receptor is “activated” (it acquires high affinity for fibrinogen) by the conformational change that takes place when the platelets are activated.\n\n****\n\n**what triggers platelet activation?**\nPlatelet activation is trigger by (among other things) Thrombin and ADP Thrombin activates platelets by activating GPCR called protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by proteolytic cleavage. Initial wave of aggregation is reversible (with the activation of thrombin, the platelet plug will be irreversible) ADP binds P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) receptors (GPCRs) → platelet recruitment activated platelets produce Thromboxin A2 (TXA2) (generated from prostaglandin H2) which is in turn a potent inducer of platelet aggregation.\n\n**what are the changes in platelets upon their activation?**\nUpon activation platelets: release of alpha and delta granules: Ca++, ADP (further platelet activation), coagulation proteins, wound healing factors, etc. change their shape (thanks to their contractile cytoskeleton), with that there’s conformational change of the membrane bound glycoprotein IIa/IIIb that increases its affinity for fibrinogen translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane surface that binds Ca++ and this serves as a nucleation site for the assembly of coagulation factor complexes\n\n**describe the coagulation cascade**\nit’s a series of Ca++ dependent reactions that activate coagulation factors, and culminates in the formation of fibrin and consequently the deposition of insoluble fibrin clot. 1. Platelet activation → negatively charged phospholipids to the platelet surface and release of Factor V from alpha granules. 2. Factor V binds to phospholipids and acts as a cofactor for factor Xa. Factor Xa converts Prothrombin → Thrombin. Thrombin converts Fibrinogen → Fibrin clot. 3. The formation of factor Xa is the convergence point between two possible pathways: Intrinsic pathway: (AP→ 12→11→9+(8)→ 10) activated (by 1. platelets) factor XII activates factor XI which activates factor IX, which in turn, with the help of activated cofactor VIII, activate factor X. 2. Extrinsic pathway: In vitro: (TF+ 7 → 10) Tissue factor acts as a cofactor in the reaction where proteolytic enzyme (factor VIIa) activates factor X. In vivo: (7+ TF → 9+8 → 10) tissue factor and factor 7 first activate factor IX, which then activates factor X with factor VIII as a cofactor. 3.\n\n**describe the functions of Thrombin**\nstimulates platelet recruitment and degranulation (aggregation and activation) participates in the generation of cross-linked fibrin: fibrinogen (soluble) → fibrin monomers activates factor XIII that covalently cross-links fibrin amplifies coagulation cascade by activating several factors (XI, V, VIII, XIII) it activates protease-activated receptors (PARs) expressed on many cells, contributing to **** in platelets: TxA2 production → platelet aggregation in ECs: expression of adhesion molecules and a variety of fibrinolytic (tPA), vasoactive (NO, PGI2), and cytokine mediators (PDGF) tissue repair and angiogenesis leukocytes: activation Anticoagulant effects: it can acts as anticoagulant preventing clotting from extending beyond the site of the vascular injury\n\n**describe the fibrinolytic cascade**\nActivation of the coagulation cascade also sets into motion a fibrinolytic cascade (24h later) ****that activates Plasmin and as a result it limits the size of the clot and contributes to its later dissolution.

Plasminogen (found inside the clot) is hydrolyzed into PLASMIN by Mainly t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator) secreted by ECs urochinase, secreted by ECs kallikrein (plasma enzymes) or factor XII-dependent pathway (possibly explaining the link between factor XII deficiency and thrombosis) or by microorganism-derived proteins (streptokinase, staphylokinase)\n\n**After activation, plasmin is controlled by:**\nPlasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI): main inhibitor of tissue- type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA), α2-plasmin inhibitor (plasma protein: binds and inhibits free plasmin) α2-macroglobulin (inhibits plasmin, kallikrein and thrombin) and the immune response.\n\n**what ensures the coagulation is confined to the site of injury?**\nRelease of t-PA (fibrinolysis) and thrombomodulin (blocks coagulation cascade) confine the hemostatic process to the site of injury.\n\n**how does the endothelium prevent thrombosis and limit clotting to**\nsites of vascular damage?

Because of the loss of the myelin sheath, there is the appearance of several neurological deficits because all the electrical impulses cannot be transmitted along the axons because the myelin sheath is necessary for the transmission. There are several pathologic disorders that can cause this loss, for example immune-mediated destruction of myelin seen in multiple sclerosis but also infections (for example bacterial) and a group of inherited disorders termed leukodystrophies (rare diseases with a genetic predisposition characterized by the accumulation of substances on the myelin causing its damage). MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) It is one of the most common diseases characterized by an immune-attack which results in the destruction of the myelin sheath. This disease occurs at any age but in 90-95% of the cases it occurs between 20-40 years so maybe we can see the onset between 10-50 years or after 50 years of age. MS is a type of autoimmune disease and is more frequent in women (as many other autoimmune diseases) affecting them 2-3 times more than men.We can distinguish two forms of MS: a sporadic form (most frequent) and a form with family predisposition (10-20% of cases). Prevalence of 1 case per 1000 persons/year in Europe and USA; link with unidentified environmental factors: latitude, climate, etc. Incidence: 15-fold higher when the disease is present in a first-degree relative and roughly 150-fold higher with an affected monozygotic twin. Here we can see (fig. 1)the distribution of MS and it is quite diffuse in North America, North Europe (Italy included) and in Australia. It’s not so diffused in (fig. 1) South America, Africa, India and Asian countries. As already said, it is an autoimmune disease, and it has been discovered that it is a multifactorial disease because genetic and environmental factors can contribute to its development. It is characterized by the presence of specific lesions caused by an autoimmune response directed against the components of the myelin sheath which gets destroyed by our own antibodies, mainly in the area of the white matter of the CNS, even though the gray matter can also be affected. The demyelination is the result of repeated immune-mediated inflammatory processes over time; these repeated crises, characterized by dramatic inflammation, are responsible for the production of antibodies against the myelin responsible for all the neurologic deficits. Saghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 81 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7 The CNS tries to repair the damage but is not able to do it completely; thus, we have only a partial re-myelination by oligodendrocytes; especially at the beginning the reparation is quite effective but over time it becomes less effective and the result is the formation of specific lesions characterized by fibrotic tissue known as sclerotic plaques. The name MS comes from the formation of multifocal sclerotic plaques. On the left (fig. 2), there is a normal neuron with a totally myelinated axon and on the right, we can see the situation after the immune attacks, and we can understand that the electrical impulses cannot be transmitted along the axon with a myelin sheath in this condition. ( fig . 2) FORMS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS We can distinguish 4 different forms of multiple sclerosis:\n\n**relapsing-remitting**\nIt is a rapidly developing form; in a few days we have the appearance of the neurological deficits, and this acute attack can be followed by a gradual, total or partial remission of the neurological functions (80% of patients). We can have repeated attacks in the following months or years but between them there are normal periods with regression of the neurological problems.\n\n**secondary progressive**\nOver time some patients show a more or less severe progression of the disease, so it does not stop.\n\n**primary progressive**\nWe have a progression of the disease since the first day (so from the first day) and not over time; 20% of patients are affected by this more severe form compared to the others because we don’t have a pause between the first and the second crisis but there is a constant progression of the disease. Saghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 82 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7\n\n**progressive-relapsing**\nProgressive condition with attacks; there is a progressive development characterized by more severe attacks compared to the first form, so these patients reach a condition of disability because they have very serious neurological deficits. CONTRIBUTION FACTORS The mechanisms responsible for this disease are not clear but what has been demonstrated is that it is a multifactorial disease so there is the involvement of:\n\n**Genetic predisposition**\n− The genes of MHC class II are involved but only in 25-35% of cases, so this means that there are also other genes involved. However, in particular patients with the haplotype HLA-DRB1*1501 have a higher risk (3 times more) of developing MS compared to other subjects. Since genes of MHC class II are involved for only a small percentage, it means that other unknown genes must be involved in the development of the disease.\n\n**Environmental and immune risk factors**\n− It has been observed that this disease is present differently depending on the geographical area due to different climate, latitude, etc. because these factors can stimulate in some way the genetic predisposition. − Vitamin D can also have a role in the development of MS and in particular a diet lacking provitamin D or insufficient sun exposure. − Cigarette smoking. − Some studies said that probably some viral agents can contribute (maybe the Epstein-Barr virus) but we don’t have reliable scientific data telling us which viruses are responsible and which are not. There are no reliable data on genetic, environmental, and immune factors but all the events able to stimulate inflammatory processes can contribute to MS pathogenesis. It has been observed that chronic inflammatory infiltrate (so chronic inflammatory cells) either inside the sclerotic plaques or outside the regions. Over time the inflammatory response can decrease but the neurological deficits remain stable. PATHOGENESIS The pathogenesis (fig. 3)is characterized by a complex and multiphase process. We can mainly distinguish 2 phases: an autoimmune attack at the beginning and then, with the progression of the disease, an axonal damage. Saghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 83 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7 (fig. 3) At the beginning, there is a crisis characterized by inflammation during which there is the production of cytokines and in particular of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha that starts to damage the endothelium of the blood brain barrier causing the release of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and the exposure of MHC class II molecules implicated in antigen recognition by the immune system. After that there is the activation of T-lymphocytes that start to express on their surface ligands for the adhesion molecules and for MHC class II molecules and start to adhere to endothelial cells and transmigrate from the bloodstream to the perivascular space, through the release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 that can degrade the components of the ECM (in particular collagen). These inflammatory cells cross the BBB and start to spread in the bundles of nerve fibers at the level of the white matter of the CNS. Activated T-lymphocytes become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4+) and start to attack the myelin sheath proteins and produce inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) stimulating macrophages and glial cells that synthesized NO and osteopontin (a glycoprotein). This is considered as the inflammatory stage of MS. After that, the B lymphocytes start to migrate from the blood to the perivascular space and they start to produce antibodies against the components of the myelin sheaths and these antibodies are responsible for the degradation of the myelin; the macrophages present in that area start to phagocyte all the fragment of myelin. Osteopontin is a special glycoprotein because it contributes to the stimulation of the production of other cytokines by Th1 cells amplifying the inflammatory response. So, at the end we have an imbalance between the production of inflammatory cytokines and the anti-inflammatory cytokines released (fig. 4) by Th2 cells with the prevalence of the inflammatory response. Saghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 84 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7 In this picture (fig. 4), it’s possible to appreciate the transmigration of activated T cells that attack the myelin and the following arrival of B lymphocytes that start to produce antibodies against myelin components degrading it; the degraded components are phagocytosed by the macrophages. INTRODUCTION CONSEQUENCE OF IMMUNE ATTACKS We have many areas where the myelin is attacked in which we have the formation of focal areas of demyelination on the myelin sheaths causing neurological deficits because, as already said, myelin is necessary for the transmission of electrical impulses. During these inflammatory crises in the white matter we also have the destruction of oligodendrocytes (because the myelin sheath is formed by extensions of oligodendrocytes) and so these damaged neurons Moreover, since there is axonal damage, the astrocytes and the other inflammatory cells present around that area start to release some neurotrophic factors trying to stimulate the production of new myelin with consequent re-myelination by the oligodendrocytes, but this is only a partial re-myelination; therefore, overtime this becomes less and less effective with consequent irreversible damage and replacement by sclerotic tissue, sclerotic plaques. In this picture ( fig . 5) we can appreciate sclerotic plaques in the start to release an excessive quantity of glutamate which is a neurotransmitter that leads to a continuous excitation of neurons until they get exhausted and so there is a destruction of the neurons because of the excessive excitation that causes the loss of their functions, excitotoxicity (toxicity of neurons caused by their extreme excitation). brainstem and spinal cord. (fig. 5) ANATOMOPATHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTIC MS is an autoimmune disease characterized by sclerotic plaques typical of the white matter, but they can also be present in the gray matter because myelin can also be inside it. These lesions have been observed in the periventricular area, corpus callosum, cerebellum, but also optic nerves, chiasm, and spinal cord. It’s possible to distinguish different types of lesions according to their morphology:\n\n**acute active, associated with acute attacks of immune system; they are characterized by:**\n− irregular margins − myelin infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages (containing products of the sheath degradation) − axonal damage however the axon is still conserved − loss of oligodendrocytes which are destroyed − poor astroglial response\n\n**chronic active, associated with the progressive form of chronic MS; they are characterized by:**\n− sharper margins − large external area rich in macrophages (mainly in the internal area) and products of advanced myelin degradation − evident axonal damage compared to the acute active ones\n\n**slow expansion, they have an inactive central area surrounded by activated microglia and some macrophages at the edges**\nSaghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 85 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7\n\n**chronic inactive, we do not have an active degradation of the myelin because these are old lesions and correspond to the sclerotic plaques; they are characterized by:**\n− net margin − myelin absence − few oligodendrocytes − macrophages and microglia cells but strong sclerotic cicatricial reaction (sclerosis, irreversible damage) due to astroglial activation SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS The clinical manifestations are various and change from person to person and can also be different because they depend on the localization of the sclerotic plaques in the CNS. They occur singularly or simultaneously.\n\n**if we have a lesion in the cerebral cortex, the neurological deficits will consist in motor, sensory and cognitive disorders (paralysis, ataxia)**\n\n**if the lesions affect the optic nerve there will be optic neuritis and retrobulbar neuritis**\n\n**if we have lesions in the brainstem there will be ophthalmoplegia and dysphagia**\n\n**in case the lesions are in the motor spinal cord the neuronal deficits will be sensory and sphincter disorders**\nAs a result of the lesions the patients can have:\n\n**Loss of sensitivity, tingling, numbness in the limbs (hypoesthesia and paraesthesia), loss of sensitivity to touch, difficulty in perceiving heat and cold**\n\n**Muscle weakness, fatigue (asthenia), muscle spasms, difficulty in movement or difficulty in coordination and balance (ataxia), language problems (dysarthria) and dyskinesias, swallowing difficulty (dysphagia, as in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease)**\n\n**Cognitive impairment, cortical dementia, characterized by a state of euphoria or crisis of spastic crying and laughing, depression**\n\n**Sexuality disorders, impotence and loss of sensitivity**\n\n**Visual disturbances, rapid visual decline, doubling of sight (diploidy), internuclear ophthalmoplegia (force deficit or paralysis movements), uncontrolled movements of the eye (nystagmus) and optic neuritis (image blur and pain in the region around the eyes or bulbar movement)**\n\n**Urinary tract disorders, frequent and/or urgent urination (pollakiuria), incontinence or retention**\n\n**Intestinal problems, constipation, diarrhea or fecal incontinence**\nThe symptoms usually appear during the acute attacks and after these acute deteriorations there is a gradual and/or progressive worsening of neurological function. The attacks are unpredictable so there are no obvious factors that can precede them and do not occur frequently during the year → 1 or 2 attacks per year. However, some are preceded by common triggers like hot environments; therefore, from one side the sun is useful to produce vitamin D but on the other side it can cause the onset of an attack especially during spring or summer. It also seems that some viral infections like common colds, flu and gastroenteritis, can increase the risk of relapse while stress can trigger an attack. Pregnancy also plays a role influencing the susceptibility to relapse (recurrence rate lower than one for each trimester of gestation); after giving birth, the risk of recurrence is greater during the first months. Saghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 86 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7 As regards the diagnosis, with an MRI we can observe the lesions in the white matter but we can also check the presence of antibodies against myelin or some fragments of myelin in the liquor by performing a liquor examination. Moreover, there are two characteristic (but not specific) clinical signs of multiple sclerosis: 1.Uhthoff's sign, aggravation of existing symptoms due to exposure to higher temperatures than usual ambient one 2.Lhermitte’s sign, sensation of electric shock that runs through the spine and legs following flexion or, more rarely, during extension of the neck (this is typical of MS) THERAPY There are two lines of therapy:\n\n**Immunomodulatory**\nModulate and control the immune system decreasing the immune attack and thus the destruction of myelin; the most used one is interferon beta-1 but there are also others (glatiramer acetate, natalizumab)\n\n**Immunosuppressant**\nThese are the most effective drugs because they totally inhibit the immune system destroying all the B lymphocytes responsible to produce the antibodies against the myelin components, but, after the treatment, the patients are totally exposed to infectious agents because all the immune cells are, indeed, destroyed. Officially approved drug for use in MS is mitoxantrone but many others are used in clinical practice e.g. azathioprine and cyclophosphamide The professor proceeded to show this video Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and the spinal cord. Myelin is the protective sheath that surrounds the axons of neurons, allowing them to quickly send electrical impulses. This myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, which are a group of cells that support Saghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 87 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7 neurons. In multiple sclerosis, demyelination happens when the immune system inappropriately attacks and destroys the myelin, which makes communication between neurons break down, ultimately leading to all sorts of sensory, motor, and cognitive problems. Now, the brain, including the neurons in the brain, is protected by things in the blood by the blood brain barrier, which only lets certain molecules and cells through from the blood. For immune cells like T and B cells that means having the right ligand or surface molecule to get through the blood brain barrier, this is kind of like having a VIP pass to get into an exclusive club. Once a T cell makes its way in it can get activated by something it encounters - in the case of multiple sclerosis, it’s activated by myelin. Once the T-cell gets activated, it changes the blood brain barrier cells to express more receptors, and this allows immune cells to more easily bind and get in, it’s kind of like bribing the bouncer to let in a lot of people. Now, multiple sclerosis is a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction, or cell-mediated hypersensitivity. And this means that those myelin specific T-cells release cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma, which together dilate the blood vessels which allows more immune cells to get in, as well as directly cause damage to the oligodendrocytes. These cytokines also attract B-cells and macrophages as part of the inflammatory reaction. Those B-cells begin to make antibodies that mark the myelin sheath proteins, and then the macrophages use those antibody markers to engulf and destroy the oligodendrocytes. Without oligodendrocytes, there’s no myelin to cover the neurons, and this leaves behind areas of scar tissue, also called plaques or sclera. In multiple sclerosis, these immune attacks typically happen in bouts. In other words, an autoimmune attack on the oligodendrocytes might happen, and then regulatory T cells will come in to inhibit or calm down the other immune cells, leading to a reduction in the inflammation. Early on in multiple sclerosis, the oligodendrocytes will heal and extend out new myelin to cover the neurons, which is a process called remyelination. Unfortunately, though, over time as the oligodendrocytes die off the remyelination stops and the damage becomes irreversible with the loss of axons. Just like other autoimmune diseases, the exact cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but is linked to both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic risk factors include being a female and having genes that encode a specific type of immune molecule called HLA-DR2 which is used to identify and bind to foreign molecules. Environmental risk factors might include infections as well as vitamin D deficiency, which is an interesting one because it might help explain why the rates of multiple sclerosis are higher at the northern and southern poles compared to the equator where there’s a lot more sunlight. Together these genetic and environmental influences might lead to the body not killing off immune cells that target myelin. So it turns out that there are four main types of multiple sclerosis based on the pattern of symptoms over time. To break this down, we can use this graph with time on the x-axis, where time refers to the lifespan of the individual, and disability on the y-axis. The first, and by far the most common pattern of multiple sclerosis, is called relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or RRMS. This condition is what we just described, bouts of autoimmune attacks happening months, or even years, apart, and causing an increase in the level of disability. For example, during a bout a person may lose some vision, but then it may be followed by improvement if there’s remyelination. Unfortunately, though, more often than not, the remyelination process is not complete so there is often some residual disability that remains, and that means that with each attack, more and more of the central nervous system gets irreversibly damaged. In the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis type there’s typically no increase in disability between bouts, so the line stays flat during that time. Now, the second type is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS which initially is pretty similar to the relapse-remitting type, but over time the immune attack becomes constant which causes a steady progression of disability. The third type is primary-progressive multiple sclerosis or PPMS, which is basically one constant attack on myelin which causes a steady progression of disability over a person’s lifetime. The final type is progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis or PRMS, which is also one constant attack but this time there are bouts superimposed during which the disability increases even faster. Specific symptoms vary a lot from person to person, and largely depend on the location of the plaques. And multiple sclerosis typically affects individuals between the ages of 20 and 40. Symptoms related to bouts can typically worsen over weeks and can linger for months without treatment. One common trio of multiple sclerosis symptoms is called Charcot’s neurologic triad and it includes dysarthria, which is difficulty or unclear speech, nystagmus, which is involuntary rapid eye movements, and an intention tremor. Dysarthria is due to Saghafi Romina, Gervasio Carolina 88 12.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.7 plaques in the brainstem that affect nerve fibers that control muscles of the mouth and throat, and this can interfere with conscious movements, like eating and talking and can lead to things like a new stutter, as well as unconscious movements, like swallowing. Nystagmus is due to plaques around the nerves controlling eye movements. Plaques around the optic nerve cause loss of vision in one or both of the eyes because of damage to the optic nerve, which is called optic neuritis. Sometimes there’s blurring or graying of the vision, or alternatively there might be a dark point in the center of vision. Additionally, if there’s damage to the nerves controlling eye movement, then eye movements can be painful and there can even be double vision, if the eyes can no longer move in a coordinated way. Finally, intention tremors can be caused by plaques along the motor pathways in the spinal cord which can affect outbound signals like skeletal muscle control. Motor symptoms can include muscle weakness, muscle spasms, tremors, and ataxia which is a loss of balance and coordination. In serious cases, this can lead to paralysis. In addition, plaques in the sensory pathways can affect inbound signals like sensations from the skin which causes symptoms like numbness, pins-and-needles, and paresthesias which are often a tingling feeling but may also be a painful itching or burning sensation. Occasionally there can be very specific sensory symptoms like Lhermitte’s sign, which is when an electric shock runs down the back and radiates to the limbs when a person bends their neck forward. Plaques can also involve the autonomic nervous system which can lead to bowel and bladder symptoms like constipation and urinary incontinence, as well as sexual symptoms like sexual dysfunction. Finally, multiple sclerosis can also affect higher order activities of the brain, causing poor concentration and critical thinking, as well as depression and anxiety. Multiple sclerosis is typically suspected when there are multiple neurologic symptoms separated in space, which is attributable to damage in different locations in the nervous system, as well as time, meaning separate bouts or flare-ups as well as remission. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is supported by an MRI which shows multiple central nervous system lesions, called white matter plaques, since these regions tend to have lots of myelin. Also, in the cerebrospinal fluid there might be high levels of antibodies, which indicates an autoimmune process. Finally a visual evoked potential can be helpful as well, which measures the nervous system’s response to visual stimuli. For treatment, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis, but there are medications which are particularly effective for the relapsing-remitting type because they lessen the severity of relapses and make them happen less frequently. Medications like corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide which is a cell cycle inhibitor, and intravenous immunoglobulin can all be used to help blunt the autoimmune process. In addition, plasmapheresis can be effective as well, which is when the plasma is filtered to remove disease-causing autoantibodies. Chronic treatment for multiple sclerosis includes immunosuppressants like recombinant beta-IFN which decreases the level of inflammatory cytokines in the brain and increases the function of T regulatory cells. Other immunosuppressants actually block T cells from getting into the brain by interfering with their cell surface molecules they use to gain passage through the blood brain barrier. Unfortunately, though, there are fewer treatment options available for the progressive MS. Instead, treatments are often targeted at managing specific symptoms—everything ranging from depression to bladder dysfunction. Physical therapy and cognitive rehabilitation therapy can be particularly helpful with sensory, motor, and cognitive symptoms. Finally, there’s also an increasing interest in the role of vitamin D as an effective treatment. As a quick recap, multiple sclerosis is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disorder, and the most common pattern is the relapsing-remitting type, where individuals have flares that come and go, with each one slightly worsening their overall condition. During a flare, T-cells cause inflammation and damage to oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, which leaves behind scarred areas of demyelinated neurons called plaques, which causes a variety of symptoms depending on the location.

The term comes from the Greek diabetes, meaning “to pass through”, and mellitus meaning “sweet”. It is characterized by polyuria (big quantity of urine expelled) associated with glycosuria (emission of glucose in the urine), so urine is sweet due to alterations of carbohydrates metabolism mainly, but also proteins and lipids metabolism. All the types of diabetes mellitus are characterized by a stable hyperglycemia, so high levels of glucose in the blood that may be due to different causes, such as lack of insulin or insulin resistance. There are complications over time, such as macro and micro-vascular diseases, we will see them in detail. If hyperglycemia is too high, so higher than 180 mg/dL is associated with polyuria and glycosuria. Fig 1 In this important paper (fig. 1) there’s a projection for 2045 to see how many cases of diabetes mellitus are present nowadays and how many are expected to be present in 20 years more or less. In general, in the world in 2021 there were 530 millions of people affected by this disease, while in 2000 they were only 151 millions. In 2045 there will be 780 million. Fig. 1shows also the countries in which there will be a higher increase in the diabetes mellitus cases, they are countries that are developing more and more, like Africa. Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 83 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 Fig 2 & 3 Here ( fig 2 ) you can see in 2021 the diabetes mellitus prevalence by age and the fact that it increases with age; the incidence in males and females is more or less the same. Here (fig 3) you see the difference between rural areas and urban areas: in 2045 compared to 2021 there is not so much difference in rural areas, the big difference is in cities. Of course, this is related mainly to the diet. CLASSIFICATION Diabetes mellitus can be classified into 4 main groups: type 1 and 2, diabetes for other causes and gestational diabetes. We will focus more on the first two. Type 1 diabetes in the past was called insulin-dependent diabetes (now it is more correct to call it just type 1 diabetes, because also other diabetes can be related to insulin, not only type 1) or juvenile diabetes (because usually is diagnosed in children but keep in mind that it can appear later in life and not only during childhood). Type 1 diabetes occurs in 10% of all diabetes cases, it is characterized by an absolute insulin deficiencycaused by destruction of the cells of endocrine pancreas producing it, the β cells. For this reason, it is considered an autoimmune disorder. Insulin is a hypoglycemic hormone, and when it lacks it causes accumulation of glucose in blood, so hyperglycemia. There are two forms of this type of diabetes: - Type 1A (immune-mediated diabetes mellitus): the autoimmune form of the disease - Type 1B (idiopathic diabetes mellitus): a rare form with unknown etiology Type 2 diabetes was in the past called insulin-independent diabetes (not correct anymore) and adult-onset diabetes (because mainly occurs in adults and the elderly, but since diabetes type 2 diabetes is associated with obesity, that is one of the main risk factors, and obesity now is very diffused also in young people, it’s not correct anymore to call it that way). It is caused by a relative insulin insufficiency, it is produced by β cells of the pancreas, but there is a sort of resistance, so cells of the periphery are not able to sense insulin: insulin is not able to bind to its receptor and it’s not able to activate the transduction pathway. The third class is diabetes mellitus from other causes, it can be caused by the removal of the pancreas because of a tumor for example, pancreatitis so inflammation of the pancreas, pancreatic tumors, cystic fibrosis, structural abnormalities of insulin, genetic defects in β cells and other causes. Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 84 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 Then there is the gestational diabetes mellitus, a diabetes that occurs in pregnant women. If the woman is already diabetic before pregnancy, we speak about pre-gestational diabetes, which may be more severe and dangerous for the newborn, because if it is not controlled it can cause malformations. The gestational diabetes which occurs later during pregnancy is less dangerous, but it has to be strongly controlled in order to avoid possible complications such as macrosomia of the fetus. Usually, this condition is completely reversed after delivery. Gestational diabetes is a sort of insulin resistance, so it’s similar to type 2 diabetes: insulin is still produced but it’s not able to act in the right way. DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made in the presence of the classic symptoms: polyuria (big amount of urine produced), polydipsia (great thirst), unexplained weight loss (we’ll see that in diabetes there’s the catabolism of lipids and proteins); and then a stable hyperglycemia, always documented in all types of diabetes. The basic tests to evaluate blood glucose levels are: - Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), the measurement of blood glucose levels when fasting 2-hours Plasma Glucose (2-h PG), the measurement of glucose levels after 2 hours of the assumption - of big amount of sugar (75 g of glucose), called the OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test), in order to evaluate how our body is able to use this glucose - Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), we’ll see that the glucose in the blood if present in high concentrations is able to bind to proteins, so proteins are glycosylated; so the measurement of hemoglobin that has been glycated is a marker of hyperglycemia. Thehealthy subject there will be, after the ingestion of 75g of glucose, a slight increase in blood sugar that over time drops to the basal level. The diabetic patient already starts from a higher basal level of glucose, then they accumulate glucose in the blood and is very difficult to lose it, it remains in the blood. Fig 4 How is the OGTT, also called “load curve”, performed? First of all, the fasting plasma glucose is measured in order to see the basal levels of glucose in the blood; then the patient ingests 75 g of glucose and at different intervals the plasma glucose is measured 2 hours after the OGTT test. This (fig 5) is a table which is very important for you to know as medical doctors. In normal conditions a healthy patient should have a FPG lower than 110 mg/dl, a 2-h PG after the intake of glucose lower than 126 mg/dl, and a glycated hemoglobin lower than 5,7% (percent meaning respect to the total hemoglobin). Diabetic patients will have a FPG higher than 126 mg/dl (it should be measured at least 2 times on different days to say that it is a diabetic condition), a 2-h PG higher than 200 mg/dl, and a glycated hemoglobin higher than 6,5%. Fig 5 In the middle there’s a condition called impaired glucose tolerance, these patients will have a FPG between 110-125 mg/dl, a 2-h PG between 140-199 mg/dl and an HbA1c between 5,7-6,4%. Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 85 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 PANCREAS The main hormones regulating glycemia are insulin and glucagon, and they are produced by the endocrine pancreas, in particular in the islets of Langerhans. The pancreatic islets are dispersed in the pancreas parenchyma, and there are different cells in them: - β cells, the most abundant (80%), they are responsible for the production of insulin; - α cells (15%), they produce glucagon; δ cells (3-5%), produce somatostatin; - - PP cells (1-2%), produce the Pancreatic Polypeptide hormone. Let’s focus on insulin and glucagon. Insulin is a hypoglycemic hormone: it is produced when there is a high concentration of glucose in blood, it’s the glucose itself that stimulates β cells to produce insulin. Insulin stimulates the cells of peripheral tissues to reduce its concentration in blood. Glucagon has an opposite function: it is a hyperglycemic hormone, so it’s produced by α cells when there’s a low level of glucose in the blood. For example, in the morning before breakfast, after fasting during night. It increases glycemia by stimulating gluconeogenesis in the liver and glycogenolysis. Fig 6 This picture (fig 6) shows you two immunohistochemistry: they are the islets of Langerhans, in brown (A picture) you can see the β cells producing insulin, and here (B picture) the α cells producing glucagon. GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS Glucose homeostasis is regulated by different processes: - Gluconeogenesis, so the production of glucose in the liver; - Glucose uptake by cells of the peripheral tissues, that have to use it as an energy source; - Action of insulin and glucagon regulating the glucose uptaken by the periphery. After an overnight fasting, low levels of glucose in the blood are present, so there is an increase in the synthesis of glucagon (hyperglycemic) and simultaneously a decrease in the release of insulin. Glucagon increases gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (degradation of glycogen to produce glucose). After the meal, the production of insulin is increased, and the production of glucagon is decreased. By this way, insulin stimulates the peripheral cells to uptake glucose, decreasing the glycemia. GLUCOSE ROLE IN INSULIN RELEASE Glucose itself has a role in the release of insulin. When you have hyperglycemia after a meal, so postprandial hyperglycemia, the glucose stimulates the β cells to produce insulin. Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 86 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 Fig 7 Glucose enters the pancreatic β cells by diffusion through a channel called GLUT-2, and once inside the cell it is used for glycolysis, so it is phosphorylatedto Glucose-6-phosphate by a glucokinase and so on; at the end you obtain ATP. ATP inhibits the passage of potassium through the K+ channel: this brings to the depolarization of plasma membrane, and the Ca2+ channels (which are voltage-gated channels, so are able to sense the depolarization) open and calcium enters inside the cell. So, the result is that you have an increase in the intracellular amount of calcium. The increase in calcium concentration is responsible for the release of insulin by β cells. Insulin secretion is not modulated only by glucose, but also other compounds like intestinal hormones called incretins. These hormones are produced by the intestine when there are high levels of glucose in blood. Two main incretins are known: GLP1 (Glucagon-like Peptide 1) and GIP (Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide). Incretins are able to increase the insulin production and simultaneously reduce the glucagon production; then they have an important role in delaying the gastric emptying, giving a sense of satiety. This is what happens physiologically. In diabetic people, incretins are not functioning, or they are not produced: in general, the incretin effect is attenuated. There are two new classes of drugs to restore the incretin function and mimic sometimes their effect: there are agonists of the receptor for GLP-1, if GLP1 is not functioning and binding to its receptors located in the pancreas and stomach, they’re similar to GLP1, and bind the GLP-1 receptor restoring the normal function; inhibitors of DPP-4, DPP-4 is the enzyme that normally degrades incretins, bringing to increase in their level. I added this picture (fig 8) yesterday: this is a drug that is not anymore available in pharmacies, because it is used a lot by people who want to lose weight, and it is an agonist of GLP-1 receptor, inducing a sense of satiety. Fig 8 ACTION OF INSULIN AT THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVEL Glucose by entering to GLUT-2 stimulates the production of insulin by β cells of the pancreas. Insulin goes to the periphery, maybe in muscles and adipose tissue, to give its signal in order to uptake glucose. How does it act? Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 87 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 Fig 9 Insulin has specific receptors that bind it (fig 9). The receptor is composed of two α subunits, which are extracellular, and two transmembrane β subunits. α subunits have the binding site for insulin, while the β have the catalytic domain. After insulin binds the receptor, there is a conformational change in the receptor bringing to the activation of the signal transduction pathway that is responsible for the uptake of glucose. As a consequence of the activation of the signaling cascade, we have the translocation to the membrane of the GLUT-4: it is responsible for the uptake of plasma glucose, so glycemia is reduced. So again, after a carbohydrate-rich meal, you have an increase in glycemia, stimulating β cells to produce insulin, as we described before; insulin acts on target cells and induces glucose uptake. Fig 10 Q from a student: where does the glucose go after? Answer: depends, glucose in the liver can be synthesized as glycogen, or it is used to produce energy for lipid and protein metabolisms and muscle tissue, or as an energy storage in adipose tissue. The main player in the pathophysiology of diabetes is of course glucose because insulin strictly regulates glucose uptake, but it also regulates the lipid metabolism by inhibiting glycolysis (so stimulating glycogenesis) and also protein metabolism. Insulin, in order to be hypoglycemic, suppresses the hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycogenolysis, the opposite of what glucagon does. Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 88 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 We see more in detail the insulin binding (fig 11) to the α subunit of the receptor: after that you see the conformational change in the receptor, so the β subunit containing the catalytic domain, which has tyrosine kinase activity, is activated and it undergoes autophosphorylation of the receptor. The autophosphorylation of the β subunit is responsible for the activation of enzymes present in the cytoplasm belonging to the IRS family (Insulin Receptor Substrates). The enzymes will activate two very important pathways, the MAP kinase pathway and PI3 kinase pathway: these pathways bring to the translocation of GLUT-4 in the membrane, so that glucose is now able to enter the cell. Fig 11 METABOLIC EFFECTS OF INSULIN AND GLUCAGON Fig 12 Insulin has many metabolic effects. The most known of insulin of course regards glucose, so in adipose tissue and in muscles there is an increase in glucose uptake, but it also reduces gluconeogenesis and increases glycogen synthesis, in order to be hypoglycemic. Insulin is also able to regulate lipid and protein metabolisms: it is an anabolic hormone, so it increases lipid and protein synthesis. In lipids, it is able to increase their synthesis but not directly: it inhibits lipolysis, so lipids are not degraded and accumulate, and it stimulates the synthesis of fatty acids. In proteins, it stimulates their synthesis in muscles. This is important to understand later the acute metabolic alterations that occur in diabetes. Glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone, it stimulates glycogenolysis and lipolysis. METABOLIC ALTERATIONS IN DIABETES If we consider the metabolic effects of insulin and glucagon, we can get what happens when insulin is not present, as in type 1 diabetes, or it cannot act on target cells, as in type 2 diabetes. The stable hyperglycemia present in all types of diabetes brings to a waste of glucose, it stays in the circulation and is not uptaken by Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 89 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 cells, and it binds to proteins glycosylating them (one of the main causes of chronic complications of diabetes). In healthy individuals, high glucose levels inhibit the release of glucagon. In diabetes mellitus, α cells are less sensitive to glucose, so glucagon secretion is not inhibited, resulting in hyperglycemia, worsening the levels of glucose in plasma (insulin not binding to receptors + insulin not inhibiting glucagon release). TYPE 1DIABETES MELLITUS This type of diabetes in the past was called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile diabetes, because of the frequent onset of this type in children. But now it has been seen that not only type 1 may be dependent on insulin assumption, and it can be present also in adults and the elderly. It is characterized by absolute deficiency of insulin, because of the destruction of β cells of the islets of Langerhans. It’s more rare in respect to the other types of diabetes, they are 5-10 % of all cases of diabetes mellitus. There are two forms: type 1A and type 1B. The immune-mediated diabetes mellitus (1A) is the most common, it’s considered an autoimmune disorder, and it is multifactorial: there is a genetic predisposition but there must be some environmental factors activating it. The peak onset is during puberty, the 75% of cases occur between 3 and 18 years old, the rest in older ages. It is characterized by stable hyperglycemia, and in 10-40% of cases also by ketoacidosis, we’ll see later what it is. Fig 13 In this picture (fig 13) you can see a graph: on X axis you have the age, on Y axis the β cells mass. There is a phase between 5 and 10 years old that is considered a preclinical phase (called also the honeymoon period): it means that β cells are actually destroyed, but they can still guarantee a sufficient insulin production because of their hyper functionality (remaining cells producing more insulin than normal). The acute metabolic alterations typical of type 1 diabetes (hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, glycosuria, polyuria...) occur when more than 90% of β cells are destroyed. So, in most cases type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder. There is a genetic predisposition to this disorder, but it is actually not sufficient for the onset of the diabetes. Some triggering factors are needed, environmental factors that activate the autoimmune response against beta cells. When the autoimmune response is activated, we observe insulitis, so inflammation of the islets characterized by lymphocytes infiltrates and production of specific antibodies called ICA antibodies (Islets Cells Auto-antibodies). Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 90 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.7 Antibodies bind to insulin, so insulin is not able anymore to bind the insulin receptor. There can be also antibodies against some specific antigens present on beta cells, that avoid the production of insulin. There are some genes that can be involved in the genetic predisposition (you don’t have to remember them). The important thing for you is to recognize the presence of polymorphism of the gene encoded for the vitamin D receptor, so it may be involved in diabetic predisposition, or also mutations in the insulin gene bringing to the creation of an insulin molecule that is not correctly formed, so it cannot bind to the insulin receptors. Genetic predisposition is not sufficient for the onset of type 1 diabetes, you need environmental factors that can trigger the autoimmune response. These environmental factors may be viral infections or dietary compounds, that in some people with genetic predisposition can trigger the immune response, such as proteins from cow’s milk (especially albumins, proteins present on the surface of β cells): in some people, the assumption of big quantities of bovine albumins can stimulate the formation ICA antibodies against these albumins, because due to a molecular mimesis the bovine albumin, which mimics a protein of beta cells, is recognized as antigen and attacked. Another possible environmental factor is the desegregation of antigens: some viral infections can damage the beta cells (not kill, only damage), allowing the cells to expose in the membrane some proteins normally found in the inner layer of the membrane, so they’re attacked by the antibodies. TYPE 2DIABETES MELLITUS About the morphology of the islets of Langerhans in diabetes type 1 just remember that due to the destruction of beta cells we have necrosis of these cells, and consequently an inflammatory reaction, insulitis. In this slide (Fig 14) you can see the little dots that are the monocyte-lymphocyte infiltrate (with nuclei occupying all the cell). Fig 14 Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents the 80-90% of all types of diabetes mellitus. In the past it was called insulin-independent diabetes mellitus or adult-onset diabetes, but now is not correct because it occurs also in children due to obesity, which is one of the main triggering factors today. It is mainly characterized by insulin resistance; it is not able for different causes to bind on its receptor and activate the signal transduction pathway. The other characteristic of this type is deficiency in insulin secretion: there is a complicated interplay between insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, this is why we cannot call type 1 diabetes insulin-dependent diabetes, because sometimes also type 2 patients may need insulin. Another characteristic is an increased hepatic synthesis of glucose. Also in this case is a multifactorial disease, there is a genetic predisposition, but the main trigger event is obesity. These two factors bring together to insulin resistance and alterate function of β cells. Endi Dingu, Elena Zeppegno 91 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 INSULIN RESISTANCE Due to the presence of insulin resistance and not a complete loss of beta-cells in the pancreas, we only have a relative insulin deficiency in type 2 diabetes and not a complete insulin deficiency as in type-1 diabetes. Decreased peripheral insulin response mainly affects skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and the liver (most sensitive to insulin). There are three main causes of insulin resistance; 1)RECEPTOR DEFECTS - considered as a genetic predisposition. This is related to a mutation in the gene coding for insulin receptors which can lead to a decrease in the number of INSR receptors on the surface of beta cells or the correct number of receptors with mutations that alter their ability to bind insulin. (Insulin is present but cannot bind to the receptors fig.1). 2)POST-RECEPTOR DEFECTS - In this case, insulin is able to bind to the receptors, but the insulin signal transduction pathways are impaired. Perhaps mutations in the receptors can lead to alterations in the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor or substrates of tyrosine kinases are altered or mutations in genes coding for GLUT-4 could prevent the translocation of GLUT receptors to the membrane or GLUT-4 is translocated to the membrane but due confirmational changes is unable to uptake glucose. 3)REDUCED INSULIN SENSITIVITY– Here insulin is Fig. 1 produced, but is unable to bind to the receptors due to abnormalities of the insulin molecule. The consequences of insulin resistance are; - Failure to inhibit gluconeogenesis in the liver (elevated fasting glucose) - Reduced glucose uptake (due to failure in GLUT-4 translocation) and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle after a meal (elevated postprandial blood glucose) - Failure to inhibit the activity of the \"hormone sensitive\" lipase in adipose tissue → excessive degradation of triglycerides in adipocytes and an excess of circulating free fatty acids (FFA). GENETIC FACTORS Genetic predisposition is greater in Type-2 Diabetes than in Type-1. However, the real risk factor together with genetic predisposition of Type-2 Diabetes is obesity. Possible to recognize family history Homozygous twin concordance > 90% (in DM1 40%) Risk of transmission if both parents are affected > 50% Some of the environmental/social factors that are related to genetic predistortion are; - Obesity - in fact about 60-80% of DM2 patients are obese - Sedentary life - Unbalanced diet (diet rich in fats, especially saturated fatty acids, and sugars) - Smoke - Hypertension In particular, abdominal obesity is the real risk factor because here the visceral adipose tissue produces a variety of metabolically active factors (like specific adipose tissue cytokines which induce inflammation, oxidative stress), some of which promote insulin resistance. Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 92 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 HOW DOES OBESITY CONTRIBUTE TO INSULIN RESISTANCE? Adipose tissue produces specific inflammatory cytokines that are called adipokines →hormones produced by the adipose tissue. The levels of these adipokines are regulated by a nuclear receptor called PPARγ (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ). This receptor induces the increased synthesis of adipokines. Among these adipokines, there is adiponectin. Adiponectin favors insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Normally, in DM2 patients these levels of adiponectin are reduced and this mechanism promotes insulin resistance fig.2 DM2 patients are given specific drugs called ‘Thiazolidinediones’, which are agonists of PPARγ and can stimulate the production of adiponectin to improve insulin sensitivity. In obese patients, there are elevated levels of free fatty acids and these FFAs are shown to cause insulin resistance. FFA bind to G protein-coupled receptors and interfere with the insulin signaling pathway → alterations in the secretion of insulin, incretins, and glucagon and promote inflammation. Obesity also causes the release of some pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL6…) that can induce insulin resistance. In insulin resistance favored by obesity, the beta-cells produce insulin which is unable to act. In the first phases of the disease, there is a compensatory hyperinsulinemia. This means that the Fig. 2 beta-cells in the pancreas try to the target cells aren’t able to sense the presence of insulin. These beta-cells eventually die and undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) and not necrosis as in DM1. Insulin atrophy is interconnected. resistance and beta-cell compensate the insulin resistance by producing more insulin. So, they are hyperactivated. However, at a certain point, they are not able to produce a bigger amount of insulin since insulin is altered and MORPHOLOGY Fig. 3 There is no necrosis of pancreatic β-cells, nor morphological lesions in these cells in DM2. In some islets, fibrous tissue fig.4accumulates, even to the point of obliterating them. The protein amyloid produced by β cells is often present in the islets, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 93 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 Fig. 4 ACUTE METABOLIC ALTERATIONS AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF DIABETES We will see some acute metabolic alterations, due to lack of insulin activity, that are related to both DM1 and DM2. As told before, the main characteristic is hyperglycemia which is present in DM1 and 2, which can lead to metabolic alterations. In addition to hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus is characterized by a TRIAD, which is also indicated as the ‘illness of the 3Ps’. These are polyuria (increased urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst) and polyphagia (excessive hunger). In addition to the TRIAD, there is asthenia (decreased muscle tone) and diabetic ketoacidosis (if DM is severe). Remember that insulin not only regulates glycemic metabolism, but also protein and lipid metabolism as shown in fig.5. As regards to lipids, the role of insulin is to inhibit lipolysis by inhibiting adipocyte lipase and favors glycogenesis. At the same time, insulin favors protein synthesis. Fig. 5 Loss of insulin function (insulin resistance) leads to consequences at the level of the adipose tissues and muscles. At the level of adipose tissues, due to insulin resistance, there is no inhibition of lipolysis. Increased lipolysis leads to the accumulation of free fatty acids. This is a form of dyslipidemia that is seen in DM patients which can cause severe complications like atherosclerosis. As regards to protein, due to insulin resistance there is reduced protein synthesis and an increased protein catabolism. Increased lipolysis and protein catabolism leads to polyphagia. In diabetic patients, the alpha cells of the pancreas are not sensible to hyperglycemia. So, glucagon is in excess and this can lead to glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis which leads to the production of glucose causing hyperglycemia. When there is hyperglycemia (more than 180mg/dL), glucose can also be found in urine leading to glycosuria. Presence of glucose in urine can also lead to osmotic imbalance causing polyuria (excessive loss of water). This can result in diabetic coma together with ketoacidosis. Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 94 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS This is caused due to the formation of ketone bodies fig.6, which is composed of three components called acetone, acetoacetic acid and β-hydroxybutyric acid. These ketone bodies are produced in the liver due to increase lipolysis starting from the release of FFA (non-esterified fatty acids). Accumulation of these ketone bodies in blood and urea leads to ketoacidosis. Acetoacetic and β-hydroxybutyric acid of ketone bodies are the two molecules that are responsible for the acidification of the pH. Fig. 6 Acetone, being volatile, in addition to passing in the urine, is eliminated with the exhaled air (rotten fruit breath). The clinical manifestations of ketoacidosis are; - Fatigue - Nausea and vomiting - Severe abdominal pain - Deep, labored breathing (Kussmaul breathing) - Depression in cerebral consciousness - Coma There are different types of comas such as; - DIABETIC COMA due to diabetic ketoacidosis. HYPEROSMOLAR COMA (HYPEROSMOLAR HYPEROSMOTIC SYNDROME, HHS) due to severe dehydration resulting from sustained osmotic diuresis (polyuria). HYPOGLYCEMIC COMA - usually occur in DM1 patients METABOLIC DERANGEMENTS UNDERLYING THE CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF DIABETES- SUMMARY 1.Since insulin is an important anabolic hormone, its deficiency causes a catabolic state that affects not only glucose metabolism, but also fat and protein metabolism. 2.↑ Glucagon secretion promotes hyperglycemia (it stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis). Not only is the assimilation of glucose in the muscles and adipose tissue sharply decreased or abolished, but also the reserves are depleted (↑ glycogenolysis). 3.The resulting hyperglycemia exceeds the renal reabsorption threshold → glycosuria. Glycosuria induces osmotic diuresis and then polyuria, causing a profound loss of water and electrolytes → severe dehydration → activation of the osmoreceptors of the thirst centers of the brain → intense thirst (polydipsia). 4.Severe dehydration → hyperosmolar coma (hyperosmolar hyperosmotic syndrome, HHS) 5.Peripheral tissues are in a persistent condition of low glucose → protein and fat catabolism. Proteolysis (skeletal muscle t.), releases «gluconeogenic» amino acids which are used as the building blocks of glucose → asthenia→ slimming (DM1). Insulin inhibits lipolysis so in the absence of insulin there is catabolism of fats → release of non-esterified fatty acids and TG → loss of fat body mass (DM1), hypertriglyceridemia and steatosis + hypercholesterolemia (dyslipidemia). Protein and fat catabolism tends to induce a negative energy balance, which in turn leads to increased appetite (polyphagia). 6.Excessive energy demolition of TG instead of glucose → free fatty acids reach the liver and are esterified and oxidized (β-oxidation of fatty acids) (ketogenesis) → release of ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid, acetone, β-hydroxybutyric acid) into the circulation = ketoacidosis (mainly in DM1). Symptoms of ketoacidosis: nausea, vomiting, respiratory distress. Ketone bodies are eliminated in the urine (ketonuria). If the acidosis is not compensated, it leads to diabetic coma and death. Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 95 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 7.Ironically, the most common acute metabolic complication in both types of diabetes is hypoglycemia (meal skipping, excessive physical activity, excessive insulin administration). Dizziness, confusion, sweating, palpitations and rapid heartbeat; loss of consciousness may occur if hypoglycemia persists → hypoglycemic coma. Reversal of hypoglycemia with oral or intravenous glucose prevents permanent neurological damage. CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES Fig. 7 Till now we have discussed about the acute alterations of metabolism in DM. So, polyuria, polydipsia, ketoacidosis, etc... are all acute metabolic alterations of DM. Now moving on to the chronic complications of DM, they consist mainly of diabetic macroangiopathy and diabetic microangiopathy. So, what are the causes of these chronic complications of diabetes? The mechanisms responsible for these complications are; - Formation of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): - due to binding of glucose to proteins - Activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC) - Oxidative stress and disturbances in polyol pathways - Hexosamine pathways and generation of fructose-6-phosphate GLYCOSYLATION OF PROTEINS AGEs are Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) that are formed due to the bonding of glucose to the amino groups of both intracellular and extracellular proteins nonenzymatically = nonenzymatic glycosylation (or glycation) of proteins. This binding can lead to a permanent alteration of the protein and its functionality. Another glycosylation of the proteins in the basal lamina which results in the alteration of the endothelium. This glycosylation favors the entrance of LDL and is the first step of the pathogenesis Glycosylation important in the pathogenesis of DM. important of of proteins example atherosclerosis. is very is the AGEs have specific receptors called ‘RAGE’. Few examples of AGE include hemoglobin bound to glucose forming glycated Hb in blood, LDL apolipoprotein B (glycosylated LDL, accelerated atherosclerosis). When LDL is glycosylated, it is more pathogenic as it can easily penetrate the intima of big arteries. Fig. 8 Plasma albumin binds to the glycosylated basement membrane of capillaries contributing to the thickening of the vascular wall seen in diabetic microangiopathy. In fig.8,you can see how AGEs induce oxidative stress in the beta-cells of the pancreas and forms amyloid plaques (toxic -> destroy beta-cells-> reduction of insulin production). This is just for your knowledge and is not necessary to remember all these steps. Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 96 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 METABOLIC MEMORY At the first stages of DM, hyperglycemic memory causes the formation of some AGEs. Even if hyperglycemia is corrected by diet, it still can form AGEs due to metabolic memory fig.9. This is because previously accumulated AGEs remain in tissues and continue to be responsible for the chronic complications of diabetes. The engagement of RAGE by AGEs leads to sustained cellular dysfunction, termed as “metabolic memory” → long- Fig. 9 term influence of previously accumulated AGEs that are capable of maintaining RAGE over-expression, sustained activation of NFkB, prolonged induction of tissue-specific inflammation, initiation and progression of long-term oxidative stress, which is persistent despite the reversal of hyperglycemia. The phenomenon is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes-related macrovascular and microvascular complications → impaired quality of life, accounting for increased morbidity, disability, mortality. As previously told, the two main chronic complications of DM are diabetic macroangiopathy and diabetic microangiopathy. MACROANGIOPATHY-> means alterations in big arteries resulting in an accelerated atherosclerosis. This can further cause thrombosis, ischemia, stroke. MICROANGIOPATHY-> results in alterations of the small vessels like capillaries. It is responsible for many complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, infections fig.10. DIABETIC MACROANGIOPATHY Here the arteries are modified making then more susceptible to accelerated atherosclerosis. This means that atherosclerosis is premature and rapidly progressive. The two main causes of accelerate Fig. 10 atherosclerosis in diabetic patients are dyslipidemia (due to high levels of LDL and low levels of HDL) and glycosylation of proteins (like LDL, basal membrane proteins). 2 to 4 times greater incidence of coronary artery disease and fourfold higher risk of dying for cardiovascular complications. Diabetes is often accompanied by underlying conditions that favor the development of adverse cardiovascular events (hypertension in 75% of individuals with DM2; dyslipidemia). Atherosclerosis in diabetes is more aggressive than in the non-diabetic population, being premature, rapidly progressive, and with the involvement of multiple arterial districts at the same time. There is also an impaired function of cells involved in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis fig.11 (ECs, SMCs, stromal cells, pericytes, inflammatory cells, circulating and tissue-resident vascular stem/progenitor cells) due to metabolic alterations of DM. Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 97 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 For example, smooth muscle cells, which are in the tunica media, are important in atherosclerotic plaque formation. They proliferate, migrate to the intima and differentiate into fibroblasts to produce a fibrous cap (EM) that covers the atherosclerotic plaque. At the same time, it has been demonstrated that there are less EPCs (Endothelial progenitor cells) in DM patients. These cells are involved in repairing vascular damage. So, defects in the number of circulating progenitor cells are associated with a more rapid progression of vascular disease in DM. There is also another group of cells called OPCs (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) which are abundant in DM patients and they come from the myeloid lineage (acquire some characteristics of osteoblasts). They stimulate ectopic calcification of the atherosclerotic plaque, which is another step in the pathogenies of atherosclerosis. Acceleration of atherosclerosis in DM is mainly due Fig. 11 to AGEs. Below is a summary on how AGEs contribute to macrovascular complications. AGEs promote endothelial dysfunction→ AGEs induce oxidative stress in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (EPCs contribute to re-reendothelialization, thus oxidative stress may hinder endothelial repair). Additionally, AGEs decrease the activity of the oxidative stress scavenger’s catalase and superoxide dismutase in ECs. AGEs contribute to foam cell formation→ Due, at least partially, to the inhibition of cholesterol efflux via ATP binding cassette (ABC) A1. AGEs promote intraplaque inflammation→ AGEs induce macrophage polarization in the so-called M1 phenotype. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. AGEs enhance proliferation of SMCs and synthesis of ECM. AGEs promote calcification→ Vascular calcification results from the deposition of hydroxyapatite minerals due to a phenotypic switch of VSMCs toward osteoblast-like cells. Calcification leads to vascular stiffening and concomitant cardiovascular risk. The presence of AGEs stimulates the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. They cause a switch from a stable to an unstable plaque fig.12. In a stable plaque, the fibrous cap is thicker, necrotic core is smaller and are not prone to rupture. But AGEs favor the transition into an unstable plaque, which has a thinner fibrous cap, thicker necrotic core and are prone to rupture. When the plaque ruptures, there is an immediate formation of an acute thrombus, which that can be responsible for a stroke when the carotid artery is blocked. When a non-occluding plaque obstructs a coronary artery, it can cause angina. When there is an occluding plaque due to the formation of a thrombus, it can lead to MI (Myocardial Infraction). Fig. 12 Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 98 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 Another complication of macroangiopathy is diabetic foot. An atherosclerotic plaque leads to the hypoperfusion of the foot which can cause inflammation and necrosis of the tissues(gangrene). Peripheral atherosclerotic vascular diseases (especially lower limbs): claudicatio intermittens + gangrene and ulcers of the lower limbs and fingers (diabetic foot) → amputations (40% of cases). DIABETIC MICROANGIOPATHY Microangiopathy can cause alterations in microcirculation and this is again due to AGEs formation. There is glycosylation of the proteins present in the basal membrane of the tunica intima of the arterial wall of the microcirculation (capillaries of the skin, skeletal muscles, retina, glomeruli, renal medulla). It is the cause of the reduced ability to heal wounds, typical of diabetics. It also contributes to the onset of retinopathy, nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY It is a frequent cause of blindness in the general population and is most severe and frequent in DM1. This is caused by neovascularization due to hypoxia-induced overexpression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor which is responsible for angiogenesis) in the retina. Treatment includes antiangiogenic agents. Diabetic patients can also be affected with maculopathy, cataract, glaucoma leading to blindness. DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY In case of DM1, 30-40% of patients experience renal failure, in DM2 it is 20%. It is the most common cause of dialysis or renal transplantation. Pyelonephritis (serious condition) = inflammatory picture due to the passage of urinary tract infections to the kidney. Due to stagnation of urine in the bladder as a result of neuropathy + glucose in the urine represents a rich growth medium for microorganisms. Infections are very common in DM due to AGES formation, by binding to the proteins of the cytoskeleton of inflammatory cells (neutrophil/monocyte/macrophage). This causes reduced neutrophil function (chemotaxis, diapedesis, phagocytic activity, microbicidal activity) and impaired cytokine production by macrophages. Therefore, infections are common in DM since there is a reduced defense mechanism and also because the micro vessels, which are important in acute inflammation, are damaged (due to glycosylation of basal lamina proteins). DIABETIC NEUROPATHY Neuropathy can lead to an autonomic nerve dysfunction resulting in bowel and bladder motility disorders. Diabetic neuropathy is responsible for the loss of tactile sensitivity. It can also cause: - Distal symmetric polyneuropathy of the lower extremities that affects both motor and sensory function. Alteration of axons, myelin sheath, Schwann cells. Microangiopathy of the vessels supplying the nerves contributes to the disease. - - Pain, but they have a high pain threshold so the diabetic tends to ignore minor irritations and traumas to the toes, joints, lower limbs → ulcers. Paresthesias in the extremities. TYPE 3 DIABETES AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE In the last years, Alzheimer’s disease has been considered as Type 3 diabetes. This is because in the brain of an Alzheimer’s disease patient there is some sort of insulin resistance. Note that type 3 diabetes cannot be considered as another forms of diabetes as it something that is involved only in the brain. It manifests as insulin resistance within the brain with consequent impairment of central insulin signaling processes → neurodegeneration, neurons aren’t able uptake glucose so they die. Peripheral insulin resistance leads to decrease insulin signaling in CNS → increased Aβ toxicity, Tau Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 99 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation → neurodegeneration. Insulin circulating in the blood can cross the BBB through a receptor-mediated active transport system + insulin is produced in the brain. It has major potential to impact neurocognition and contributes to the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease will be further discussed later but what is important to know is that it is a neurodegenerative disorder (means that there is the accumulation of materials in cells). Alzheimer’s disease like all the other neurodegenerative disorders is a selective degeneration which means that only some particular areas of the brain are affected (specifically the neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus). Other neurons remain intact. Neuronal death in the cerebral cortex causes atrophy. Fig. 13 Talking about the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, there are two pathological causes which are neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques fig.13. The neurofibrillary tangles are intraneuronal and are found inside the neurons. They are formed due to the modification of a protein called ‘tau’, that is involved in the stabilization of microtubules. When this protein is modified, it detaches from microtubules and aggregates in neurons giving rise to these tangles. The amyloid plaques are extracellular and are formed due to the accumulation of amyloid beta, which is neurotoxic causing the death of neurons from outside. It has been shown that insulin resistance (T3D) can cause amyloid plaque formation of accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles. In fig.14,the mechanisms that occur in the neuron are shown. Here insulin binds to the receptor, then after a transduction pathway there is a translocation of GLUT-4 to the membrane that favors the uptake of glucose. This is a scheme of a Crosstalk Between Brain Cholesterol Oxidation and Glucose Metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease. In the lesson dyslipidemias, we learnt that alterations in cholesterol metabolism of the brain can cause Alzheimer’s disease. Now, we have seen that alteration in glucose metabolism is also responsible for the onset of this disease. Fig. 14 METABOLIC SYNDROME It is a highly prevalent condition defined by the presence of at least three out of five risk factors including central obesity, increased fasting glucose(hyperglycemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), and dyslipidemia. Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 100 20.04.2023 GAMBA L.8 It is associated with a 2-fold increase in cardiovascular outcomes and a 1.5-fold increase in all-cause mortality. These are the five risk factors that are used to diagnose a metabolic syndrome and if 3 out of these 5 are present it can be diagnosed as a metabolic syndrome. 1)Central (abdominal) obesity, waist circumference > 94 cm in men and > 80 cm in women (Europe, country-specific). 2)Hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 150 mg/ml) 3)Low blood levels of HDL cholesterol (< 40%ml in men and < 50%ml in women) 4)Systemic hypertension (≥ 130 / ≥ 85 mmHg) 5)Elevated fasting blood glucose ≥ 110 mg/ml (index of more or less marked insulin resistance) Usually, a metabolic syndrome is characterized by a state of hypercoagulability of the blood (increased blood levels of PAI-1: Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1). This is a risk factor for atherosclerosis as thrombus formation is favored. In fig.15, you can see how central obesity differs from region to region. Fig. 15 Jayamaha Tamasha, Zogheri Allegra 101", "input": "", "output": "**Definition**\nHeterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia which may be due to defects in insulin production, secretion or action, which over time are often complicated by the onset of micro- and macro-vascular diseases and neuropathies.\n\n**Statistics:**Prevalence in the world, compare past and estimated future\nnumbers, age group, sex, etc. DM is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. The incidence is rising. Today it affects more than 500 million people in the world and it’s estimated to reach almost 800 million by 2050. It’s incidence increases with age. It affects men and women alike.\n\n**name the different types**\nThere are four types Type 1 DM Type 2 DM Gestational diabetes DM from other causes\n\n**Describe type 1 diabetes**\nType 1 is normally developed in childhood / young adulthood (3/4 cases develop between 3-18 y.o.) It is autoimmune. It accounts for 5-10% of all DM cases. There are two types: type 1A, the most common of the two, it is an autoimmune-mediated destruction of islet cells of the pancreas that produce insulin so the patient can no longer produce it. It arises in genetically predisposed subjects and exposed to environmental factors that act as triggering factors. 10-40% of cases present with ketoacidosis. Type 1B is idiopathic and is mostly found in Africa and Asia.\n\n**Describe type 2 DM**\nit accounts for 80-90% of all DM cases. Type 2 historically used to develop almost exclusively is older patients, today that’s no longer the case and it can affect people of all ages. It’s etiology is a combination of genetic predisposition (runs in families), and environmental factors. In a large number of cases it is associated with obesity: BMI > 30 → risk of developing DM2 increases 30-fold characterized by: insulin resistance, which is an insulin response deficit. insulin secretion deficiency (beta cells are hyperplastic but functionally impaired) increased hepatic gluconeogenesis The lack of insulin is not absolute but relative.\n\n****\n\n**Diabetes mellitus from other causes?**\nIt refers to diabetes caused by other injuries or diseases such as pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, genetic defects in islet cells, structural defects of insulin, iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment like glucocorticoids), cystic fibrosis, infections, etc.\n\n**Gestational diabetes?**\nThe hormonal changes during pregnancy may cause insulin resistance. It usually resolves after delivery. It requires rigorous control of blood glucose to avoid the risks of congenital malformations, fetal macrosomia and delivery problems.\n\n**How is the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus made?**\nDiagnosis of DM (for all types) is made based on: Classic symptoms: polyuria, polydipsia and unexplained weight loss. Hyperglycemia measured in 2 separate occasions\n\n**Which tests are used to measure blood glucose level?**\nFPG (fasting plasma glucose) 2h PG (plasma glucose following OGTT) Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)\n\n**Explain OGTT**\nIt’s a test where glucose is administered to the patient to evaluate its metabolism. 1. Measure FPG 2. Patient drinks a solution of 75g of glucose 3. Glycemia is measured at regular intervals during the following 2h to assess\n\n**A healthy subject would experience an initial surge in glucose followed**\nby a drop to a level lower than baseline due to pancreatic response. A diabetic patient already starts with an elevated blood glucose that increases even more, it takes longer than normal to go down and does not return to normal baseline\n\n**Which is the normal fasting glucose level?**\n70-100 mg/dl\n\n**Which fasting glucose level is considered elevated but not yet**\ndiabetes? 100-125 mg/dl\n\n**What is a normal percentage of glycated glucose?**\nBelow 5,7%\n\n**Which percentage of glycated glucose is indicative of diabetes?**\nFrom 5,7% to 6,4% is considered pre diabetes. From 6,5% is diabetes\n\n**Compare the 2hPG values expected in normal, impaired and diabetic**\nindividuals Normal 2hPG should be <126 mg/dl Diabetic is >200 mg/dl Impaired is anything in between.\n\n**Which values can we expect to find after performing all three tests on**\na normal subject? FPG: 70-100 mg/dl 2hPG: <126 mg/dl HbAc1: <5,7%\n\n**Which values indicate impaired glucose tolerance and which ones**\nsupport a diabetes diagnosis? Impaired: FPG: 100-125 mg/dl 2hPG: 126-199 mg/dl HbAc1: 5,8%-6,4%\n\n**Diabetes**\nFPG: >126 mg/dl 2hPG: >200 mg/dl HbAc1: >6,5%\n\n**What is normal post prandial glycemia?**\n80-120 mg/dl and it quickly returns to normal in 2-3 hours\n\n**what are the three main regulators of glycemic balance?**\nthe liver (glucose production) peripheral tissues (uptake) insulin and glucagon (so also the pancreas and the intestine)\n\n**how is the glucose balance after an overnight fast?**\nHypoglycemia → Glucagon is elevated, Insulin is suppressed. There’s glycogenolysis (glycogen synthesis is inhibited) and gluconeogenesis in the liver (and a little in the kidneys), this glucose is taken mainly by non-insulin-dependent tissues (brain, intestine and erythrocytes)\n\n**how is the glucose balance after feeding?**\nHyperglycemia → Glucagon is inhibited, Insulin is elevated. There is inhibition of gluconeogenesis and there is insulin-dependent uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.\n\n**explain the mechanism of glucose-mediated insulin release**\nat a concentration of 75 mg/dl of glucose, glucose diffuses into pancreatic beta cells through GLUT2 transporters. Inside, it is converted into G6P by glucokinase and it’s funneled into Glycolysis ultimately yielding ATP. ATP inhibits an ATP-dependent K+ channel. In the absence of ATP (hypoglycemia) the channel is activated and K+ is extruded (hyperpolarization) When there’s glucose → ATP → K+ channel is inactivated → This causes a depolarization of the membrane that activates voltage- sensitive Ca++ channels. Ca++ entering the cell leads to the release of insulin from preformed granules.\n\n**what nutrients other than glucose stimulate insulin secretion?**\naminoacids (leucine, lysine, arginine) incretins: peptide hormones released from the intestine in response to local glucose. They stimulate pancreatic β-cells postprandially, to secrete insulin (and cause an inhibition of glucagon). They also delay gastric emptying. GIP: Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide GLP1: glucagon-like peptide-1\n\n**describe the insulin receptor cascade**\nThe insulin receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor composed of two cytosolic beta subunits and two extracellular alpha subunits (ligand-binding) held together by disulfide bonds. Ligand binding triggers autophosphorylation of the cytosolic tyrosine residues, which leads to the phosphorylation of several proteins of the IRS family (insulin receptor substrates), this leads to a cascade that activates the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways (cell growth, differentiation, protein lipid and glycogen synthesis) AKT induces membrane translocation of GLUT4.\n\n**sum up the effects of insulin in glucose metabolism**\nhypoglycemic (it removes glucose from blood) promotes the peripheral utilization of glucose stimulates glycogen synthesis in the liver inhibits glycogenolysis decreases gluconeogenesis\n\n**sum up the effects of insulin in lipid metabolism**\nstimulates the synthesis of fatty acids stimulates the conversion of glucose into triglycerides decreases the production of ketones decreases the mobilization of fatty acids from deposits\n\n**sum up the effects of insulin in protein metabolism**\npromotes protein synthesis promotes synthesis of some enzymes and inhibits synthesis of other enzymes decreases a.a release form cells stimulates RNA synthesis increases half life of mRNA\n\n**Describe the glucose metabolism alterations in diabetes**\nHyperglycemia: glucose stays in the circulation, it binds to proteins (glyc. hemoglobin), or it is excreted in the urine (glycosuria). decreased peripheral glucose utilization increased gluconeogenesis increased mobilization of glucose from stores decrease in glycogen\n\n**describe the lipid metabolism alterations in diabetes**\nincreased mobilization of fatty acids from stores increased supply to peripheral tissues → steatosis increased oxidation of fatty acids increased production of ketones → ketosis Hypercholesterolemia → macroangiopathy, atherosclerosis\n\n**describe the protein metabolism alterations in diabetes**\nreduction of protein synthesis increased activity of gluconeogenesis enzymes (e.g. transaminases, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase) glycosylation of proteins (Hb)\n\n**what happens to alpha cells in diabetes?**\nIn healthy individuals: high glucose levels inhibit glucagon release. In DM: alpha cells are less sensitive to glucose → ↑ glucagon secretion → hyperglycemia.\n\n**what is ketoacidosis?**\nSerious metabolic condition resulting from the excessive demolition of TG instead of glucose for energy purposes, with the release of ketone bodies (acetate acetic acid, acetone, beta-hydroxy-butyric acid) into the circulation.\n\n**Describe the genetic susceptibility to DM1**\n50% of the genetic susceptibility to T1D is associated with the HLA gene cluster Some DQ and DR haplotypes have been identified as carrying the most predisposing risk still, there are more than 20 non-HLA related genes whose polymorphism could predispose to the disease: LPM2: subunit of the proteasome involved in antigen processing prior to association with MHC molecules. CTLA4 e PTPN22: involved in the regulation of T lymphocyte activation. CD25: regulates the activity of Treg lymphocytes. ICAM1: responsible for the inappropriate homing of T lymphocytes in the islets. VDR: gene coding for the vitamin D receptor. Insulin gene (Insulin can present structural modifications in the amino acid sequence which makes it functionally inefficient.)\n\n**what triggers the autoimmune response that starts DM T1a?**\nViral infections during intrauterine life or in the first period after birth. Dietary factors: cow's milk proteins (especially albumin for similarity with molecular components of β cells); hypovitaminosis D in the presence of gene polymorphism for the vitamin receptor (VDR).\n\n**In general, they can cause molecular mimetism and/or**\ndesegregation of antigens. molecular mimetism is when there’s high molecular homology between exogenous antigens and self molecules. This triggers ICA (Islet Cell Autoantibodies) production. E.g. PC-2 protein of Coxackie B4 is similar to GAD65 expressed on β cells; bovine albumin similar to protein 69. Desegregation of antigens: Infection can damage β cells leading to exposure of normally segregated molecules that can be recognized by autoreactive lymphocytes → autoantibody production (ICA targets are cytoplasmic)\n\n**describe the clinical onset of type 1A DM**\nAlthough the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes is often abrupt, there is a lengthy lag period between initiation of the autoimmune process and the appearance of disease, during which there is progressive loss of insulin reserves In the preclinical phase (or honeymoon), while the destruction of beta cells may have already started, the exogenous requirements may be minimal due to the hyperfunctionality of the remaining cells. DM1a becomes clinically evident when beta cell loss has reached 80-90% and there’s severe insulin deficiency which manifests as hyperglycemia and ketosis.\n\n**describe the morphology of pancreatic islets in DM1**\nINSULITIS: inflammation in the pancreatic islets. Infiltrate contains mainly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, accompanied by macrophages and neutrophils. They release IL-1, IL-6, interferon α, and nitric oxide (NO) that contribute to β cell damage. β cells are progressively destroyed and it is no longer possible to identify the cells still able to produce insulin. Loss of β cells results in islets of different sizes. Pancreatic islet fibrosis is rare. There is no amyloiddeposition.\n\n**Describe the causes and consequences of insulin resistance**\nThe causes can be: mutations to the insulin receptor gene defective receptor less receptors post-receptor defects GLUT mutations mutations in other secondary messengers of the transduction pathway insulin molecule defects\n\n**Consequences:**\nHaving insulin resistance means the peripheral insulin response is diminished. This affects mainly the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Liver: gluconeogenesis is not inhibited → high fasting glucose decreased glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis → high postprandial blood glucose No inhibition of the \"hormone sensitive\" lipase in adipose tissue → excessive degradation of triglycerides in adipocytes and an excess of circulating free fatty acids (FFA)\n\n**what about genetic factors and DM2?**\nGreater impact in the onset of DM2 than in DM1. 1st degree family history 5-10 fold increased risk Risk of transmission if both parents are affected > 50% Homozygous twin concordance > 90% (in DM1 40%) at least 30 different loci related to increased suceptibility\n\n**what are the environmental risks for DM2?**\nObesity (which itself may be genetically based): 60-80% of DM2 patients are obese. Specifically visceral fat produces a variety of metabolically active factors, some of which promote insulin resistance Sedentary life Unbalanced diet (diet rich in fats, especially saturated fatty acids, and sugars) Smoke Hypertension\n\n**How does obesity contribute to insulin resistance?**\nAdipokines (cytokines from adipocyte origin) some promote hyperglycemia, and others (leptin and adiponectin) decrease blood glucose in part by increasing insulin sensitivity. In obesity there’s low adiponectin, contributing to insulin resistance. adipokine levels are regulated by PPAry (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ), Thiazolidinediones: group of insulin-sensitizing drugs that modulate the activity of PPARγ, used in the treatment of DM2. FFA (free fatty acids): There’s an inverse relationship between fasting plasma FFA and insulin sensitivity. Excess FFA bind to GPCRs and interfere with insulin signaling. They also overwhelm fat oxidation pathways causing an accumulation of toxic fat metabolites (DAG, sphingolipids, and phospholipids) that can attenuate the insulin cascade and activate inflammatory pathways in the islets that further damage beta cells. Inflammation: the release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL6, IL1, etc released from visceral fat induce insulin resistance.\n\n****\n\n**Describe the morphology of the islets in DM2**\nThere is no necrosis of pancreatic βcells, nor morphological lesions in these cells. In some islets, fibrous tissue accumulates, even to the point of obliterating them. The protein amyloid produced by β cells is often present in the islets (amyloidosis of the pancreatic islet), especially in patients over 60 years of age.\n\n**describe the state of absolute insulin deficiency**\nAn absolute insulin deficiency leads to a catabolic state, culminating in ketoacidosis and severe volume depletion. These cause sufficient central nervous system compromise to lead to coma and eventual death if left untreated.\n\n****\n\n**In addition to hyperglycemia, DM is characterized by the P TRIAD:**\nPolyuria Polydipsia Polyphagia\n\n****+ Asthenia (↓ muscle tone)**\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (if severe DM)**\n\n**what is ketoacidosis?**\nInsulin inhibits lipolysis. In the absence of insulin (mainly in DM1) the hormone sensitive lipases are free to mobilize fat from deposits, release non- esterified fatty acids (FFA) that undergo β-oxidation of in the liver. The enzyme β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA converts acetoacetic acid →into β-hydroxybutyric acid or acetone(ketone bodies). Some ketone bodies are eliminated in the urine (ketonuria), acetone can also be eliminated in the breath (rotten fruit halitosis), but excess acids also accumulate in the plasma in the form of sodium salts, lowering blood pH (acidosis). The clinical manifestations are: Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Severe abdominal pain Deep,labored breathing (Kussmaul breathing) Depression in cerebral consciousness Coma\n\n**what types of coma can be a consequence of diabetes?**\nDIABETIC COMA due to diabetic ketoacidosis. HYPEROSMOLAR COMA (HYPEROSMOLAR HYPEROSMOTIC SYNDROME, HHS) due to severe dehydration resulting from sustained osmotic diuresis (polyuria). HYPOGLYCEMIC COMA\n\n**what underlies the weight loss and dyslipidemia and polyphagia in diabetes?**\nSince insulin is an important anabolic hormone, its deficiency causes a catabolic state that affects not only glucose metabolism, but also fat and protein metabolism. ↑ Glucagon secretion promotes hyperglycemia (it stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis). Not only is the assimilation of glucose in the muscles and adipose tissue sharply decreased or abolished, but also the reserves are depleted (↑ glycogenolysis). Peripheral tissues are in a persistent condition of low glucose → protein and fat catabolism. Proteolysis (skeletal muscle t.), releases «gluconeogenic» amino acids which are used as the building blocks of glucose → asthenia → → slimming (DM1). Insulin inhibits lipolysis so in the absence of insulin there is catabolism of fats → release of non-esterified fatty acids and TG → loss of fat body mass (DM1), hypertriglyceridemia and steatosis + hypercholesterolemia (dyslipidemia). Protein and fat catabolism tends to induce a negative energy balance, which in turn leads to increased appetite (polyphagia).\n\n**what can lead to a diabetic coma?**\nExcessive energy demolition of TG instead of glucose → free fatty acids reach the liver and are esterified and oxidized (β-oxidation of fatty acids) (ketogenesis) → release of ketone bodies (acetacetic acid, acetone, β-hydroxy- butyric acid) into the circulation = ketoacidosis (mainly in DM1). Symptoms of ketoacidosis: nausea, vomiting, respiratory distress. Ketone bodies are eliminated in the urine (ketonuria). If the acidosis is not compensated, it leads to diabetic coma and death\n\n**what can lead to a hyperosmolar coma?**\nhyperglycemia exceeds the renal reabsorption threshold → glycosuria. Glycosuria induces osmotic diuresis and then polyuria, causing a profound loss of water and electrolytes → severe dehydration → activation of the osmoreceptors of the thirst centers of the brain → intense thirst (polydipsia). Severe dehydration → hyperosmolar coma (hyperosmolar hyperosmotic syndrome, HHS)\n\n**what can lead to a hypoglycemic coma?**\nIronically, the most common acute metabolic complication in both\n\n**types of diabetes is hypoglycemia (meal skipping, excessive physical activity, excessive insulin administration). Dizziness, confusion, sweating, palpitations and rapid heartbeat; loss of consciousness may occur if hypoglycemia persists → hypoglycemic coma. Reversal of hypoglycemia with oral or intravenous glucose prevents permanent neurological damage.**\n\n**what are the two major chronic complications of diabetes**\n\n**by which mechanisms does chronic hyperglycemia cause micro- and macro angiopathies?**\n(it is not just the hyperglycemia, it is also the comorbidities like obesity and insulin resistance) There is at least four proposed mechanisms: Formation of AGEs Excessive PKC activation: hyperglycemia stimulates DAG accumulation, which overactivates PKC. Results in excessive profuction of some growth factors: VEGF, TGFb, and the procoagulant PAI1. Oxidative stress: excess of glucose (not enough hexokinase), glucose is metabolized through the polyol pathway first to sorbitol (reaction uses NADPH) and then to fructose, using NAD+. This reactions consume NADPH needed to regenerate glutathione and can ultimately cause oxidative stress. Hexosamine pathway and generation of fructose-6-phosphate excess glucose is also funneled through the hexosamine pathway which results in cell damage and oxidative stress.\n\n**Explain how AGES contribute to angiopathies**\nAdvanced Glycation End products are the product of non-enzymatic, covalent binding of glucose derivatives to proteins. Hyperglycemia accelerates AGE formation. AGE binds its receptor, RAGE, in T cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells and signaling causes: proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and ECM increased procoagulant activity increased ROS in endothelium release of cytokines and growth factors (TGFb, VEGF..) →linked to retinopathy\n\n**AGEs also cross link ECM proteins. This can decrease vessel elasticity when they bind (and criss-cross) collagen I. They criss-cross collagen IV in the basement membrane and interfere with endothelial cell adhesion, and increase extravasation of fluid. Glycosylated proteins can bind to other nearby proteins:**e.g. Plasma albumin binds to the glycosylated basement membrane of capillaries contributing to the thickening of the vascular wall seen in diabetic microangiopathy.\nModified cellular proteins are for example: Hemoglobin (Hb A1C) (blood marker of hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus, ≥ 6,5%) Lens protein (cataract) Collagen (platelet hyperaggregability, macro/microangiopathy) LDL apolipoprotein B (glycosylated LDL, atherosclerosis)\n\n**what is the effect of AGEs in pancreatic Beta cells?**\nAGEs/RAGE signaling enhances oxidative stress and increases inflammation in pancreatic β-cells. The generation of ROS leads to the formation and aggregation of toxic islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) species and affects their amyloidogenicity. These toxic IAPP intermediates bind to RAGE and form an amyloid plaque → pancreatic β-cell toxicity.\n\n**what is intended by metabolic memory in the context of AGE/RAGE signaling?**\npreviously accumulated AGEs can maintain RAGE over-expression, sustained activation of NFkB, prolonged induction of tissue-specific inflammation, initiation and progression of long-term oxidative stress, which is persistent despite the reversal of hyperglycemia. The phenomenon is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes-related macrovascular and microvascular complications → impaired quality of life, accounting for increased morbidity, disability, mortality.\n\n**describe diabetic macroangiopathy**\nIn DM the most common complication is atherosclerosis (a type of macroangiopathy). it is a very aggressive atherosclerosis because it’s premature, rapidly progressive, and it involves multiple arterial districts. At the same time there’s impaired function or reduction of cells involved in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis (ECs, SMCs, stromal cells, pericytes, inflammatory cells, circulating and tissue-resident vascular stem/progenitor cells). The precipitating factors are 1)alterations of lipid metabolism, 2) glycosylation of proteins that are in the basement membrane of the intima Diabetes is often accompained by other conditions that favor the development of adverse cardiovascular events (hypertension in 75% of individuals with DM2; dyslipidemia) The plaque has a larger necrotic core, the inflammation is greater, and calcification is greater too (Increased mobilization of osteoprogenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood and to the arterial wall) DM ptts have 2 to 4 times greater incidence of coronary artery disease and fourfold higher risk of dying for cardiovascular complications. Atherosclerosis mainly affects: coronary arteries, cerebral arteries, arteries of the extremities. It leads to Myocardial infarction (leading cause of death among diabetics) Brain stroke Renal ischemia Peripheral atherosclerotic vascular diseases (especially lower limbs): claudicatio intermittens + gangrene and ulcers of the lower limbs and fingers (diabetic foot) → amputations (40% of cases).\n\n**what is the role of AGEs in macrovascular complications?**\nAGEs promote endothelial dysfunction → induce oxidative stress in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (EPCs contribute to re- endothelialization, thus oxidative stress may hinder endothelial repair). Additionally, AGEs decrease the activity of the oxidative stress scavengers catalase and superoxide dismutase in ECs. AGEs contribute to foam cell formation → Due, at least partially, to the inhibition of cholesterol efflux via ATP binding cassette (ABC) A1. AGEs promote intraplaque inflammation → AGEs induce macrophage polarization in the so-called M1 phenotype. AGEs enhance proliferation of SMCs and synthesis of ECM. AGEs promote calcification → Vascular calcification results from the deposition of hydroxyapatite minerals due to a phenotypic switch of VSMCs toward osteoblast-like cells. Calcification leads to vascular stiffening and concomitant cardiovascular risk. MGO (Methylglyoxal, AGE precursor) may directly lead to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis-related inflammation, and angiogenesis inhibition. By contrast, MGO may also lead to AGE formation and, in turn, affect atherosclerosis development.\n\n**what are the factors that promote retinopathy, nephropathy and**\nperipheral neuropathy in DM? retinopathy, nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy result from diabetic microangiopathy. that results from glycosylation of the proteins present in the basal membrane of the tunica intima of the arterial wall of the microcirculation (capillaries of the skin, skeletal muscles, retina, glomeruli, renal medulla). It is the cause of the reduced ability to heal wounds, typical of diabetics.\n\n**describe diabetic retinopathy**\nMost frequent cause of blindness in the general population. Most severe and frequent in DM1. Neovascularization due to hypoxia-induced overexpression of VEGF in the retina. Treatment: antiangiogenic agents Maculopathy, cataract, glaucoma → blindness\n\n**describe diabetic nephropathy**\nIn case of DM1, 30-40% of patients experience renal failure, in DM2 it is 20%. It is the most common cause of dialysis or renal transplantation. Pyelonephritis (serious condition) = spread of urinary tract infections to the kidney. Due to stagnation of urine in the bladder as a result of neuropathy + glucose in the urine represents a rich growth medium for microorganisms.\n\n**why are DM patients predisposed to infections?**\nPredisposition to infections (skin, oral mucosa, genital mucosa, urinary tract, lungs). Bacterial and viral infections, due to glycosylation of neutriphil/ monocyte/macrophage cytoskeletal proteins → reduced neutrophil function (chemotaxis, diapedesis, phagocytic activity, microbicidal activity) + impaired cytokine production by macrophages. Urinary tract infections: glucose in the urine represents a rich growth medium for microorganisms. situation aggravated by urinary retention (diabetic neuropathy) → ascent of microorganisms from the bladder to the kidney → pyelonephritis.\n\n**describe diabetic neuropathy**\nDistal symmetric polyneuropathy of the lower extremities that affects both motor and sensory function. Alteration of axons, myelin sheath, Schwann cells. Microangiopathy of the vessels supplying the nerves contributes to the disease. Pain Paresthesias in the extremities Loss of tactile sensitivity Increased pain threshold: the diabetic tends to ignore minor irritations and traumas to the toes, joints, lower limbs → ulcers. Autonomic nerve dysfunction → bowel and bladder motility disorders.\n\n**what’s the relationship between diabetes and alzheimer?**\nsome refer to Alzheimer’s disease as “diabetes of the brain” or “type 3 diabetes (T3D). It manifests as insulin resistance within the brain with consequent impairment of central insulin signaling processes → neurodegeneration. Peripheral insulin resistance leads to decrease insulin signaling in CNS → increased Amyloid β toxicity, Tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation → neurodegeneration. Insulin circulating in the blood can cross the BBB through a receptor-mediated active transport system + insulin is produced in the brain It has major potential to impact neurocognition and contributes to the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n**define metabolic syndrome**\nDiagnosis is made on the presence of three out of the following risk factors: Abdominal obesity waist circumference > 102 cm in men waist circumference > 88cm in women Hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 150 mg/dl) Low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL in men, <50 mg/dL in women Hypertension (≥ 130 / ≥ 85 mmHg); Fasting blood glucose >100 mg/dL Treatment for hypertension, diabetes, and lipids (so the patient has one of these diseases but the levels are currently normal only due to therapy)\n\n**Often characterized by a state of hypercoagulability of the blood**\n(increased blood levels of PAI-1: Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1) Associated with a 2-fold increase in cardiovascular outcomes and a 1.5-fold increase in all-cause mortality."}

The parts colored in gray are those explained by him previously and not by Gamba during this year’s lecture, but were kept in the sbobina because they may add useful information. The main subjects we try to address are nutritional diseases and disorders, adverse reactions to food, allergies and intolerances, celiac disease. MALNUTRITION An appropriate diet should provide sufficient energy in the form of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, vitamins and minerals. The proper diet should contain at least 50-55% of the food intake in carbohydrates. So carbohydrates should be the main source in a proper balanced diet. For people doing sports it is the same. Carbohydrates represent the most important fuel in our body, in fact if you think about the ATP production by a single molecule of glucose you easily recognize the importance. It is not necessary to eat too many proteins because you just overload the kidney function (10-20%). As far as lipids are concerned, not many are needed, maximum 20-30%. We have two main carbohydrates classes: simple sugars and complex sugars. We need to eat complex sugars and not too many simple sugars because they are almost immediately absorbed, on the contrary complex sugars have a delayed effect because it takes two/three hours to absorb them. So when we say that a balanced diet should contain at least 50-55% of the food intake in carbohydrates, we are mainly talking about complex sugars even if it depends on physical activity, basal metabolism and energy demand. An equilibrated diet should also include a wise way of food intake meaning it is better to split the daily calorie intake into 3 or 5 different small meals instead of eating the majority of food for instance in the evening. If you eat all the majority of your calories in the evening you go to bed and do not consume the calories. It is better to eat dividing meals at different moments. It is important to differentiate between primary malnutrition and secondary malnutrition. Primary malnutrition is when all the components are missing from the diet, while secondary malnutrition is a type of malnutrition due to other pathologies, related to malabsorption for example. At the end the result is the same, this components are missing from the body, but the difference depends on the etiology of the malnutrition. The conditions that may lead to malnutrition are a lot: - poverty; - self-imposed dietary restrictions (conditions like anorexia or bulimia); - ignorance and failure of diet supplementation. Ignorance because for example we should know that folic acid is essential in pregnant women, but because of ignorance it may not be supplemented; - advanced cancers in which cachexia occurs; - chronic alcoholism; - gastrointestinal pathologies and malabsorption syndromes, genetic diseases (may cause malabsorption and secondary malnutrition); - specific pharmacological therapies and total parenteral nutrition; - infections. Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 50 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 MAJOR DISEASES AND CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INADEQUATE DIGESTION AND FOOD MALABSORPTION 1) Gastric resection, accelerated gastric emptying (short bowel syndrome = sindrome dell’intestino corto) 2) Pancreatic insufficiency (for example we have seen cystic fibrosis, a recessive disorder whose name comes from this fibrotic tissue at the level of the pancreas. In the case of cystic fibrosis we have a pancreatic insufficiency and the lack of production of pancreatic enzymes leads to a malabsorption due to genetic disorders.) 3) Pathologies of the liver and biliary tract with cholestasis 4) Congenital or acquired lactase deficiency 5) Intestinal villous atrophy (celiac disease) 6) Chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa The last two of course lead to malabsorption and secondary malnutrition. It is important to not intake an insufficient amount of carbohydrates because we need glucose for energy, if it is not sufficient we use lipids and then proteins - amino acids and fatty acids to produce energy and this is not good. On the contrary, an excessive carbohydrate uptake especially in the case of simple sugars is not good because then they become a good substrate for new lipid synthesis, so you increase the rate of lipid synthesis especially in the liver causing the production of TGs (triglycerides) and so liver steatosis. Moreover, too many lipids in the gut make the digestion difficult, causing diarrhea, meteorism because the microbiota takes advantage of this excess of lipids. If we do not have enough amino acids and protein intake our protein synthesis will be impaired and lead to blood clotting deficit (due to deficit in protein synthesis), impairment of immunological defenses. On the other hand, if we eat too many proteins we give extra work to our kidneys. It depends on age, in aging people the problems are amplified. If we do not have a sufficient uptake of lipids we have an impaired absorption of fat soluble vitamins (A, E, K, D) and also we need long chain fatty acids, whereas short chain FAs could be provided by a physiological healthy microbiota. An excessive uptake of lipids will lead to troubles in digestion. Long digestion problems like diarrhea are present. SAM SAM stands for Severe Acute Malnutrition. It is a new way to indicate PEM, that stands for Protein Energy Malnutrition (in Italian malnutrizione protidoenergetica), and was used until some years ago. Now in new textbooks, it is called SAM and it is common in low income countries and around 25% of children are affected by it. Malnutrition is determined based on the BMI (body mass index). BMI is the calculated as the ratio between weight (expressed in kg) and squared height (expressed as squared meters). If this value is less than 16 kg/m2, the person is considered to be affected by malnutrition. Two people can appear different and still have the same BMI because it also depends on the distribution of fats and skeletal muscles. Other useful parameters are: - fat reserves (thickness of skin folds), - muscle mass (reduced circumference of the central part of the arm), - serum protein (the measurement of albumin and transferrin). Proteins like albumin are measured in order to understand whether you are in front of a person will malnutrition, because a typical sign of malnutrition is hypoalbulinemia (low levels of albumin in the blood), - gut microbioma (it changes in people with malnutrition) Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 51 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 There are two differently regulated protein compartments in the body: 1) somatic compartment (proteins in skeletal muscles) 2) visceral compartment (protein stores in the visceral organs, primarily the liver). It is composed by the proteins that are more vital for our organs. MARASMUS In Italian it is called Marasma. It is characteristic mainly of children that are lacking calories, they have a deficit in total calories, not only proteins. These are children that do not eat enough fats or proteins. A child is considered to have marasmus when weight falls to 60% of normal for sex, height, and age and has low BMI (lower than 16). They are characterized by growth retardation and loss of muscle because in case of deficit in total calories we have catabolism and depletion of the somatic protein compartment. The visceral protein compartment, which is presumably more precious and critical for survival, is only marginally depleted, and hence serum albumin levels (and other proteins in the blood) are either normal or only slightly reduced. Subcutaneous fat is also mobilized and used as source of energy. Anemia may be also present and signs of multiple vitamin deficiencies are present. For example we have seen that vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis and a megaloblastic anemia can be present. Vitamin C is important for the absorption of iron, so in case of a deficiency also iron is depleted and there is a sideroblastic anemia. and there is evidence of immune deficiency (concurrent infections). and the few that reach the blood are bigger. This is because the proerythblasts try to divide, so the cytoplasm becomes bigger but the DNA is not able to duplicate and divide, so this gives rise to a bigger cell. This depends also on the susceptibility of the child, because he may have a megaloblastic anemia because of the lack of B12 but microcytic anemia because of the lack of iron. Question: why we see megaloblastic anemia in this? Answer: because vitamin B12 is present in all the foods of animal origin and the precursors of red blood cells in the bone marrow are not able to divide and proliferate and it causes megaloblastic anemia, so megaloblasts die inside the bone marrow and so few red blood cells are released in the blood Fig. 1 KWASHIORKOR The most common form of SAM in African children who have been weaned gives rise to generalized edema. This is because the low colloidosmotic pressure in the blood brings fluid to exit from the blood and reach the tissues. This kind of edema is called transudate, not to be confused with inflammatory edema, the exudates. The loss of weight in these patients is masked by the increased fluid retention, very severe condition. Fat deposits are maintained, muscle atrophy is less marked than in marasmus. Less severe forms can be too early and fed, almost exclusively, a carbohydrate diet. They do not eat proteins but only carbohydrates and so a marked protein deprivation is associated with severe depletion of the visceral protein compartment . Proteins of the liver are catabolized and the resultant hypoalbuminemia seen in individuals with chronic diarrheal states. Fig. 2 The term is originated from Ghana and it means “the disease of the first child”. This is because when the second child is born, the mother gives milk to the second and the Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 52 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 first child loses his milk. Both marasmus and kwashiorkor are characterized by different types of anemia. It may be microcytic because of the lack of iron or macrocytic because of the lack of vitamin B12. The brain may be also affected if the child suffers from this malnutrition during the first 1 or 2 years of life or if children are born from mother that suffer from malnutrition, the brain may be less developed have and cerebral atrophy already at birth. SECONDARY MALNUTRITION Secondary malnutrition often develops in chronically ill, elderly, and bedridden patients. More than 50% of older residents in nursing homes in the United States are malnourished. The signs of secondary malnutrition are: (1) Depletion of subcutaneous fat (2) Muscle atrophy (3) Ankle or sacral edema (4) Increased risk of infection (5) Impaired wound healing (6) Anemia CACHEXIA Cachexia is a sort of secondary malnutrition that occurs in patients with advanced cancers. It is a highly debilitating condition characterized by: 1) Extreme weight loss 2) Fatigue 3) Muscle atrophy (Mortality is generally the consequence of atrophy of the diaphragm) 4) Anemia 5) Anorexia NFkB. NFkB translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and also some muscle specific ubiquitin ligases. So NFkB activation favors the ubiquitination of proteins and proteins that are ubiquitinated are recognized by the proteasome and are degraded by it. This results in the loss of myocytes. I won’t ask you about cachexia, this is just an 6) Edema The major mechanism of cachexia is the destruction of proteins by the proteasome. In particular we have the PIF (proteolysis-inducing factor) that together with the TNF and other cytokines released by the tumor or by the host cell bind to specific receptors and activates example I wanted to add. Fig. 3 VITAMIN DEFICIENCIES Vitamins may be fat soluble or water soluble. Vitamin A, vitamin K and vitamin D are all liposoluble. Vitamins can be synthesized by our body or absorbed through the diet. Vitamin D is an example of a vitamin synthesized by our body but it can be also assumed with the diet. Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 53 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 Vitamin deficiency can also be primary or secondary (due to other diseases that avoid the absorption of the vitamin).\n\n**Vitamin A**\nVitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin. It is present as preformed VitA in foods of animal origin. Also, the preformed VitA represents 70% of all the vitamin A that we have to assume. The other 30% is represented by the vitamin A in the form of provitamin A present in vegetables, for example the carotenoids and beta-carotene is the main one present in vegetables, like in carrots. Beta carotene or vitamin A in the form of retinol is absorbed by the intestine and charged in lipoproteins called chylomicrons. These reach the liver and bind to specific receptors on hepatocytes that recognize the apolipoprotein E that surrounds chylomicros. Retinol enters the hepatocytes and it is esterified into retinyl esters, which is the form of retinol that can be stored in the tissues. In case of need, the retinol binds to specific binding proteins and reach the peripheral tissues. Also in the peripheral tissues, retinol may be esterified in order to be stored and used only when needed. Its main functions are: 1) Maintenance of normal vision 2) Cell growth and mainteinance of the differentiation of Fig. 4 epithelial cells (important in the differentiation of the muco- secreting epithelium). The compound that in particular is responsible for the maintenance of the differentiation of epithelial cells is the retinoid acid that comes from the oxidation of retinol in the periphery. 3) Metabolic effects (e.g. drug metabolism, fatty acids…) 4) Stimulation of the immune system 5) Photoprotection 6) Antioxidant It is protective towards all epithelia, it has an epithelial tropism. The causes of vitamin A deficiency are general undernutrition (or primary malnutrition) and secondary malnutrition due to malabsorption of fats that characterizes cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis, we have the lack of pancreatic enzymes that brings to fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, diarrhea and all the vitamins that are fat-soluble are lost. The vitamin A deficiency brings to impaired vision, in particular in reduced light. In particular you have problems because of the purple pigment, the production of which needs a sufficient amount of vitamin A. If this doesn’t happen we have hemeralopia, where in the late afternoon you don’t see properly because of the low levels of light. In particular, even in the conjunctiva and cornea you have an increased production of connective tissue. It causes epithelial metaplasia and keratinization. As I told you, retinol is important in maintaining the differentiation of cells. Metaplasia is characterized by the morphological changes of well differentiated cells in another well differentiated cells. For example the squamous metaplasia. The term squamous refers to the cells in their final conformation. In the airways, the epithelium is psudostratified (monolayer that appears as a multilayer because of the organization of the nuclei), columnar and ciliated. The metaplasia is characterized by the loss of the cilia and the acquisition of new phonotypical characteristics and the cells become squamous. The squamous metaplasia of the Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 54 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 epithelia is a characteristic of the vitamin A deficiency and this happens mainly at the level of the epithelium of the conjunctiva and the lacrimal ducts bringing to this pathological condition called xeroftalmia, characterized by dryness of the conjunctiva (also called dry eye). At the level of the eye, we can find the bitot spots, corneal ulcers and also keratomalacia, which is the more severe condition at the level of the eye and can lead to blindness and is characterized by the erosion of the corneal surface. This is due to the dry eye and to the fact that this squamous metaplasia sometimes is also characterized by keratinization (deposition of keratin). This characteristics can be also present at the level of the respiratory tract, so a kind of keratinized squamous metaplasia similar to the metaplasia that appears in the smokers. Remember that metaplasia is an adaptation to a condition, in this case vitamin A deficiency so it is a reversible condition in case of the restoration of normal quantities of vitamin A and tissue may be again normal, but the problem is that metaplasia is a precancerousis so it has high probability to become a malignant tumor. A deficiency could cause problems in all epithelia, including intestinal, neurological and cardiovascular. We should be very careful about supplementing vitamin A because it could easily lead to hypervitaminosis. When you give a vitamin complex, a mixture of different vitamins that includes vitamin A, you should be careful not to prolong the vitamin supplementation over two or three months, to avoid hypervitaminosis.\n\n**Vitamin D**\nIt is another fat-soluble vitamin. it is characterized by endogenous synthesis in the skin starting from Fig. 5 the precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol that thanks to a photochemical reaction (UVB radiation) (~ 90%). This reaction results in the synthesis of cholecalciferol, known as vitamin D3 and synthesized endogenously in the skin. It can also be assumed in the diet, only 10% is present in food, for example dairy foods. Cholecalciferol is not so active, it has to be metabolized by the liver and the kidney. In the kidney there are important enzymes that oxidize vitamin D giving rise to1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D. 1 and 25 are the positions in which cholecalciferol is oxidized. Remember that this oxidized form is created thanks to the enzymes present in kidney and liver, so if we have problems at the level of the liver or kidney also vitamin D may not be oxidized and so activated. The main steps of vitamin D metabolism are: 1) Photochemical synthesis of vitamin D from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin and absorption of vitamin D from foods 2) Binding of vitamin D to plasma α1- globulin (D- binding protein or DBP, which is a transporter) and transport into the liver. 3) Conversion of vitamin D into 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25-OH-D] in the liver, through the action of 25- hydroxylases (enzyme present in the liver), including CYP27A1 and other CYPs. 4) Conversion of 25-OH-D into 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D [1α,25(OH)2D3], the most active form of vitamin D, by the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase in the kidney. Main functions of vitamin D are to preserve the adequate plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus. Conditions of hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia are able to be sensed by the kidney that activates these enzymes and brings to the formation in that moment of more active vitamin D. The Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 55 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 high levels of active vitamin D bring to a sort of negative feedback, because if we have too much or sufficient active vitamin D the kidney stops oxidizing new 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, while if it is needed it is oxidized. 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin Dstimulates the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, made through active transport in the small intestine and passive transport in the colon. Vitamin D regulates especially the absorption of calcium, especially in the small intestine where the transport is active. Vitamin D is important for bones and muscle function and reactivity, and also against infections. Also the parathyroid glands have the important role to sense the extracellular concentration o calcium. When there is a condition of hypocalcemia, the parathyroid glands produce the PTH that stimulates the kidney to oxidize the inactive form of vitamin D creating the active form and at the same time the PTH stimulates the maturation of the osteoclasts that degrade bones bringing the release of calcium. For instance, during Covid-19, in many groups with moderate to severe disease, vitamin D was very low. This is probably a secondary consequence, but some people suggested supplementing Covid patients with vitamin D, and other people suggested using vitamin D to prevent viral infections. Vitamin D is an oxysterol, and it could contribute to good antiviral response. Fig. 7 I prefer to start explaining this (fig.6) from point 4. When you have low serum concentration of calcium and phosphate in the blood, the parathyroid gland produces PTH. PTH stimulates the maturation of osteoclasts so calcium is taken from the bones and at the same time it stimulates the kidney to oxidize the 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to the 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D. This active compound goes to stimulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorus to restore their concentration in blood. The consequencies of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia are at the level of the bone mineralization and it can bring to rickets (in Italian rachitismo) in children (fig.7). In growing children it is characterized by micrifractures, skeletal malformations, malformations not only at the level of the legs that have a particular shape similar to arches and also at the level of the head which has flat occipital bones and deformation of the parietal ones. Also the sternum may be Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 56 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 Fig. 6 convex. In adults the lack of vitamin D is called osteomalacia, characterized mainly by being prone to fracture. Hypocalcemic tetany is a convulsive state due to the low calcium concentration of ionized calcium, which is required for normal neural excitation and the relaxation of muscles.It’s easy to get a vitamin D deficiency, especially in some areas where there’s not enough exposure to sun. Hypervitaminosis D is very rare, even in supplemented people, contrary to hypervitaminosis A. Fig. 7\n\n**Vitamin C**\nIt is also called ascorbic acid and it is a water soluble vitamin. It derives exclusively from the diet (liver, milk, fish, lemons, oranges, tomatoes and the food that contains the biggest quantity vitamin C is the pepper). The main function of vitamin C are: • activation of enzymes that lead to the formation of collagen in particular the vitamin C accelerates the hydroxylation of pro-collagen and in this way collagen can be produced and excreted from the fibroblasts in the right way; • it has antioxidant properties (for examples a lot of creams for women are rich in vitamin C because of their anti-oxidant properties) • Facilitates intestinal absorption of iron. Iron, to be absorbed, must be in the reduced form, and vitamin C needs to be absorbed in the oxidized form. Thanks to vitamin C iron can be absorbed and used for the production of red blood cells. Often young ladies using iron supplementation are provided with iron and vitamin C in the oxidized form, that reduces iron. It’s easier to absorb iron if it’s coupled with vitamin C. Scurvy (in Italian scorbuto) is the consequence of hypovitaminosis C, and it gives many problems. It’s difficult to have hypovitaminosis C in our area, but there are countries in which fruits and vegetables are not of easy assumption and in 15th and 16th century it was diffused in sailors that did not have fresh fruits. In our case vitamin C Fig. 8 deficiency could be only due to a specific malnutrition, like alcoholism, which interferes with the absorption of various nutrients. Alcohol can give gastritis and gastroenteritis, it could favor damage to our gastric and intestinal mucosa. It is characterized by poor vessels support that results in bleeding tendency because and collagen is missing, it is impaired. This shown at the level of the gums, the skin because the little vessels may rupture, impaired wound healing or scar formation. It is well absorbed in our intestine especially in oxidized form, so dehydroascorbic acid (the reduced form is ascorbic acid). Vitamin C and vitamin E react well together. Vitamin E is in the cell membranes, and one single molecule of vitamin E keeps under control about 2000/3000 molecules of polyunsaturated fatty acids, because of the very tight and efficient interaction with vitamin C. When polyunsaturated fatty acids undergo oxidation, vitamin E rapidly gives an electron so the free radical reaction is blocked and the polyunsaturated fatty acid is not damaged and not broken down. But now vitamin E is oxidized in the middle of the membrane, and once it’s oxidized the molecule Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 57 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 moves towards the cytoplasm and it’s at the internal border of the membrane. Here it’s able to interact with hydrosoluble antioxidant vitamin C, which loves to be oxidized. As soon as it interacts with vitamin E, vitamin C gets oxidized, gives the electron to vitamin E and vitamin E is ready to go back in the middle of the membrane and work to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids.After 2-3 months of vitamin A retinol supplementation there is a risk of moderate hypervitaminosis, so epithelia may be in trouble. Usually vitamin E employed in supplements is ɑ-Tocopherol. There are 4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienols. The molecule exerting the best antioxidant action is ɑ-Tocopherol, so that’s what supplements provide. Vitamin E has a strong antioxidant activity, as said above.\n\n**Vitamin B12**\nWe spoke about this when talking about anemia. Vitamin B12 or methylcobalamin is an important co-factor in the synthesis of B12. It is present in food of animal origin like meat or milk and it is taken up by the protein. To be absorbed at the level of the intestine Fig. 9 needs to be bound to this violet molecule (fig.9) that is intrinsic factor. The intrinsic factor is produced and released by the parietal cells of the stomach and binds vitamin B12 and at the level of the intestine the intrinsic factor binds to specific receptors and in this way the binding of B12 can be passive. I want to focus on the intrinsic factor that is necessary. The lacking of vitamin B12 can be due both to a primary malnutrition (like veganism, because they do not eat foods of animal origin) or it can be due to a secondary malnutrition for example chronic gastritis conditions in which the cells of the stomach are not able to produce the intrinsic factor. It can be also due to conditions at the level of the intestine in which the receptor for intrinsic factor are not exposed or there is an inflammatory condition that avoids the binding and the absorption of the complex vitamin B12-intrisic factor. Or there is another disease, that is pernicious anemia. It is an autoimmune condition in which there are auto-antibodies directly against the gastric parietal cells. So these antibodies block the production of the intrinsic factor or they can be directly against the intrinsic factor itself and in this case it is not able to bind the vitamin B12 or against cubilin, which is the receptor. In this case B12 is assumed, but cannot be absorbed. Also pernicious anemia is a cause of secondary malnutrition. The consequence is a megaloblastic anemia. At the level of the bone marrow these proerythroblasts are bigger than normal because they are trying to divide, but the DNA is impaired. So bigger erythroblasts are present in the bone marrow and usually they die in the bone marrow, so it is an intramedullary death of the precursors of the red blood cells. The consequence is an insufficient erythropoiesis, few erythrocytes are released in the blood and those few are bigger than normal. These macrocytic erythrocytes are often destroyed also in circulation. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are similar in the symptomatology. Pregnant ladies are given folic acid supplementation independently of their serum concentration, because there’s no problem with hyperaccumulation and it’s important to have sufficient folic acid for DNA synthesis. Folic acid and vitamin B12 behave in a similar way but with an exception: only vitamin B12, in case of deficiency, Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 58 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 is able to induce neurological symptoms. They are very important in nucleic acid synthesis and in the synthesis of the heme group. This activity is essential, otherwise you would have megaloblastic anemia.\n\n**Vitamin K**\nVitamin K can have two different sources: vegetables (K2) and our microbiota, good commensals are producing vitamin K1 for us. We don’t really face any hypervitaminosis with vitamin K. Vitamin K is important in blood clotting and a decrease in vitamin K you have derangement of blood coagulation. Hydrosoluble vitamins don’t give hypervitaminosis, you can eat as much as you want and they don’t accumulate, the body removes the excess. But there are different deficiencies, and some of them are of interest in the REDOX biology of our body. Some vitamins belonging to the B family are important in redox biology, regulating oxidative and reductive processes.\n\n**Thiamine, B1**\nIt is important in regulating carbohydrate metabolism. Deficiency of this vitamin leads especially to neurological problems. Beri-Beri is a syndrome not frequent anymore but typical of the far East, where the diet was deficient in particular of vitamin B1. The symptomatology was characterized by immunological problems, intestinal problems and cardiovascular problems.\n\n**Vitamin B2 and B3**\nThey are important in the redox regulation of different functions of our cells and organs. They are so important because they are the main component of coenzymes FAD, NAD and NADPH. Vitamin A, E, B2, B3, C are important in the redox regulation of many functions. The main biochemical pathways regulating metabolism and functions in cells are dependent on calcium, on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and on reduction and oxidation.\n\n**Vitamin B6 and B7 are important in different metabolisms, in particular in the structure and function of skeletal muscle.**\nADVERSE REACTIONS TO FOOD They can be 1.toxic reactions, they are intoxications, there is not individual difference 2.non toxic reactions, could be a.due to altered immune response (=allergies) i. IgE dependent ii. non-IgE dependent (characterized by other types of immunoglobulins that are produced) iii.mixed a.not of immunologic order (=intolerances, which are difficult to diagnose) i.enzymatic type ii.pharmacologic type iii.induced by food additives 1.Toxic type (intoxications) There is not any distinction among individuals so the toxin hit all of us. There are different types of toxins: from poisonous mushrooms like Amanita phalloides, Amanita verna, Amanita virosa which may be fatal; then from contaminants of food stuff, when the storage is not adequate (like in the Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 59 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 so called biological foods) we can have the growth of dangerous microorganisms e.g. aspergillus which produces aflatoxins. The carcinogenic properties of these compounds imply that the consumption is repeated along the time, along the years. More common and frequent are intoxications because of Clostridium Botulinum, Staphylococcus Aureus and Salmonella Typhi. Intoxications are involved in all the people assuming the contaminated food. Fig. 10 2a. Allergies This are adverse reactions to foods that are non toxic. They are very diffused. They can be IgE dependent or not, for example in the case of IgA or IgG antibodies. The latter is the case of the celiac disease, which is a non toxic adverse reaction to food non IgE mediated and can be considered also an autoimmune disorder, but is wrong to consider it as an intolerance. The food allergies mediated by IgE can be mediated by allergens and is characterized by the release of IgE. Usually give symptoms in a few minutes, hours so the reaction is fast, acute, sometimes very strong as in the case of anaphylaxis. An allergen stimulates the production of IgE. IgE are bound specifically to the mast cells, that we saw in acute inflammations. They are rich in granules that contain a lot of inflammatory mediators like histamine. In case of repeated exposure to allergen, so a second exposure to the allergen, the latter finds already IgE on the surface of mast cells so the binding of the allergen with the IgE leads to the explosive degranulation of the mast cells, and so all the vasoactive amines and histamine are released causing the allergic reaction. This is just to say that IgE mediated allergies are characterized by IgE production and degranulation of the mast cells. On the contrary, the allergies not mediated by IgE, but still mediated by improper reaction of the innate immunity, show a late onset of symptoms. To complicate the all picture there is an increasing number of conditions characterized by IgE and non IgE mediated symptoms: you have the symptoms from the very beginning lasting for hours or days. Mechanism of allergies (figure below): allergens start the first phase of sensitization of cells, in particular mastocytes and basophils that start expressing on the surface IgE and it is only the second encounter with the same or similar allergen because of the reaction of IgE on the surface of the cell, there is a massive, acute release of inflammatory mediators like histamine and prostaglandins that cause the allergic reaction which leads to local and systemic symptoms in particular conjunctivitis, nasal allergy, asthma, urticaria. Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 60 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 structure allergen. Fig. 11 The symptoms of IgE mediated food allergies: the individual reaction can be specific so symptoms depend on the single individual and also on the amount of sensitizing bacteria. More frequent causes of IgE mediated inflammatory reactions, local or systemic: milk, wheat, eggs. The cross reactivity of different allergens: the reaction is not triggered only by the same allergen that made the sensitization but also by a close Fig. 12 Here is just a list of non IgE mediated allergies: the first 3 are enteropathies (colitis, proctocolitis), they are occurring very early in the childhood and are characterized by abnormal innate immune responses to some protein content of a given food. The T helper reactions could be mainly driven by type 1 and 2. Another similarity is the involvement of inflammatory cells, dendritic cells, production of proinflammatory cytokines. Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 61 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 Regarding eosinophilic GI disorders, they could be divided into esophagitis, gastritis, enterocolitis. In this case you have a mixed condition in which IgE is present but not only IgE so it is a IgE non IgE dependent condition. Again, usually in these disorders the inflammation is T helper 2 type. The response mediated by Th1 is mainly leading to activation of cytotoxic T cells response while Th2 response, typical of allergies, is producing antibodies. Fig. 13 Fig. 14 CELIAC DISEASE This disease is very diffused. The incidence is 1 out of 100 people so it is pretty common. Also in literature, celiac disease is commonly called gluten intolerance or an autoimmune disorder without going in depth about the etiology, BUT IT IS NOT AN INTOLERANCE, it is an autoimmune disease. Also in the texts it is difficult to define it. What is sure is that this is a non-IgE mediated food allergy. It is an immune mediated disorder that can be also considered an autoimmune disorder because the immunoglobulin produced can also attack cells and tissue and it triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods and also other foods that are naturally gluten-free but they may be contaminated by gluten because they are made in the same laboratory in which gluten is used. IgE are not involved, the celiac disease is in between allergies and intolerances. Allergies and autoimmune diseases are close. Symptoms are different, but only some people will show this adverse reaction and the reaction will be different among different celiac patients. They include digestive problems, anemia, skin rash, and joint pain, in children also growth retardation. It is a disease that causes secondary malnutrition, due to malabsorption of the main components of the diet only when the patients eats these kinds of food containing gluten. The gluten-free diet completely restores the normal condition. The prevalence of the disease varies in different regions and depends on the wheat consumption. In some papers it is written that in countries in which wheat is widely used, like in Western countries, the celiac disease is more diffused. It may also depend on age in which wheat has been given to Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 62 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 babies. This disease can occur in young children but also in adults, between the ages of 30 and 60. It is characterized by chronic diarrhea, bloating, or chronic fatigue, but is often asymptomatic. There are patients that if they eat some gluten have no symptoms while others have acute ones. These cases may present with anemia due to chronic iron and vitamin malabsorption. PATHOGENESIS OF CELIAL DISEASE Fig. 15 When celiac disease is active (when the patients eats gluten), it is characterized by the loss of villi in the intestine. The main problem with celiac disease is structural change of the upper part of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum) where the majority of villi are present. You could have maybe only a lymphocytic inflammation, so typical of chronic type and then damage of the villi so flattened mucosa. There are different degrees of severity of syntomps. The picture shows you normal and flattened villi. We have a flattening of the villi by the increase number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and the increase mitosis of the enterocytes. Gluten is digested into lipopeptides creating some aminoacids and also lipopeptides that cannot be digested like gliadin. Gliadin is a 33 amino acid peptide. Gliadin stimulates enterocytes to produce zonulin. Zonulin binds specific receptors on the enterocytes and this binding leads to the contraction of enterocytes and the destruction of tight junctions. Gliadin is present at the surface of the lumen of our intestine stimulates the enterocytes to produce interleukin 15. Interleukin 15 is able to stimulate the proliferation of the intraepithelial lymphocytes. The intraepithelial lymphocytes express on their surface this marker, NKG2D (not important to remember), and it is important because it allows the lymphocytes to recognize the enterocytes that have expressed MIC-A (ligand of the marker) and it is expressed by those enterocytes that are under stress (for example inflammation, altered microbiota and other stimuli). The epithelial lymphocytes attack the enterocytes expressing MIC-A and they destroy them, so they die of necrosis. Moreover in this way some spaces are created between the enterocytes and gliadin passes and enters the epithelium. At the same time gliadin also stimulates the epithelial cells to produce a molecule called osteogen that destroys the tight junctions, such as occludin, that are Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 63 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 binding the enterocytes creating new spaces in which gliadin can pass. Gliadin when enters the epithelium it finds an enzyme (the green one fig.16) that is tissue transglutaminase (tTG) that is released by the damaged cells. It is an enzyme of enterocytes and in case of destruction of enterocytes it is released. The role of the enzyme is to deamidate the gliadin. So we have now a deaminidated gliadin. The deaminidated gliadin binds specifically to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 that are present in the celiac disease patient that are on the surface antigen presenting cells (APC). In turn this binding brings the activation of lymphocytes that produces specific antibodies that are IgA or IgG directed against gliadin, so they are antigliadin antibodies and anti-tTG that recognize the enzyme tissue transglutaminase and also anti-endomysium, that is that part of the subendothelium exposed at the damage of the endothethelial cells that expose the basal lamina and the endomesium. These antibodies reach the endomysium that is a self tissue, but it is normally not exposed. In this way, celiac disease can be considered an autoimmune disorder, because of the presence of these antibodies. When the antigliadin antibodies and anti-tTG act near the endothelium they damage even more the endothelium. So the cause of the destruction of the enterocytes are the intraepithelial leukocytes that directly kill the enterocytes or the antigliadin Fig. 16 antibodies and anti-tTG that attack in the nearby of the enterocytes or the anti-endomysium antibodies. There is another type of diagnosis, the genetic diagnosis. So the trigger element is gluten, which is not a single protein but a complex of proteins. Some of us that develop enterocytes are processing the gluten in an improper way - those affected by celiac disease. Usually enterocytes endocytose gluten, fragment it and express on the surface to the MHC receptors in a way to give tolerance to that component of gluten. In some people there is a different expression of these receptors, the DQ types, and in an unusual way the DQ receptors expressed on the surface of enterocytes are of the class DQ2, DQ8. In this way, the cytotoxic T lymphocytes are recruited and activated and you have a cytotoxic reaction against the cells expressing on the surface DQ2 and DQ8. Here there is the second method of diagnosis: the genetic analysis of DQ class, you find DQ2 and DQ8 highly expressed. There is a genetic predisposition and a genetic analysis can be done to understand if in the family there are cases of celiac disorder not to test continuously every year the antibodies or perform other invasive exams but analyze if there are HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 on the Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 64 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 APC. This indicates a predisposition, not a Fig. 17 sure condition of celiac disease. From necrotic cells you have material released and some of it could act as antigens now, you could have antibodies, not IgE, against transglutaminase, also against endomysium, so antibodies like transglutaminase - the most used as lab marker for celiac disease. To treat it (which is not sufficient of course to treat celiac disease) we can prescribe antibodies against transglutaminase. These are the symptoms (of course present only when gluten is eaten): Digestive symptoms are more common in children and can include: •feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen •chronic diarrhea •constipation •gas •nausea •pale, foul-smelling, fatty stools •stomach pain •vomiting Adults are less likely to have digestive symptoms and, instead, may have one or more of the following: •anemia •bone or joint pain •depression or anxiety •dermatitis herpetiformis •headaches •infertility or repeated miscarriage •missed menstrual periods •seizures These are the exams that can be done to understand if a person is celiac. Detection in vitro of: - IgA anti-Transglutaminase - IgG anti-Transglutaminase - IgA anti-endomisium In vivothe final conclusive diagnosis of celiac disease is just made by endoscopy because you see altered small intestine mucosa, maybe in the bioptic sample you see just a lymphocytic infiltration (the first degree of celiac disease) or you recognize an already damaged villi. These antibodies determine the atrophy and the loss of the villi of the intestine. This is clinical manifestation of the celiac disease. This happens always when a celiac patient eats some gluten by mistake, because also a little amount of gluten or a contamination may cause the atrophy of the villi and the clinical manifestations. It can also be asymptomatic. The celiac person even if asymptomatic, it does not mean that they can eat gluten, because also in asymptomatic patients it changes the structure of Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 65 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 the villi and may bring to cancer. This is because a change in the differentiation in the morphology of the cells is always due to changes at the level of the DNA, some genes are overexpressed while other are downregulated. It may lead eventually to mutation and cancer if the gluten free diet is not followed. Question: do we call celiac disease precancerosis or is simply a predisposition? Answer: no, because if the diet is followed the intestines are normal, there is not atrophy of the villi. The atrophy of the villi occurs in patients that do not follow the diet because they are asymptomatic and maybe they do not know. In that case it is a precancerous condition. This (fig.18) is the proposed screening algorithm for celiac disease. It seems complicated but I like to explain this because it can be useful. Here (top of the image) we have a patient with signs and symptoms (anemia, diarrhea and some general malaise). He first thing to do is to measure IgA anti-Transglutaminase, but also the total IgA to understand if the total quantity of IgA is normal, otherwise identifying a specific type of IgA may be difficult. If there is a positive result for IgA anti-Transglutaminase, we have to perform the duodenal biopsy. If there is a positive result, we see the atrophy of the villi and there is the certain diagnosis of celiac disease. Otherwise, if the IgA anti-Transglutaminase result is negative, we cannot exclude celiac disease because have have to evaluate whether the total IgA is lower than normal. If they are lower than normal we have to measure the other antibodies created in celiac disease: IgG anti-Transglutaminase and IgA anti-endomisium. If they are positive, the biopsy is performed and if the biopsy is positive the celiac disease diagnosis is confermed. Otherwise if the total IgA are normal and the anti-Transglutaminase are negative, it is unlikely that we have a celiac disease and the biopsy is not performed since it is an invasive procedure. Fig. 18 Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 66 24.03.2023 GAMBA L.5 2b.Intolerances We can now spend some time on food intolerances. They are difficult to diagnose but if you are not able to find any type of immunoglobulins you should consider the possibility of facing an intolerance. Intolerances could recognize enzymatic, pharmacological, food additives mechanisms. Lactose intolerance is more frequent than celiac disease. Lactose is a disaccharide. The most famous is lactose intolerance due to a deficit of lactase, the enzymes able to digest lactose dividing it in glucose and galactose. Lactase is present on the brush border of the small intestine. Deficit does not mean absence. If lactase is not present or present in low amounts, lactose remains as a disaccharide in the lumen and so as a consequence water brings to a very severe diarrhea. An intolerance is different from, for example, celiac disease in which we have an immune response. There are foods that contain histamine or other vasoactive amines and that if consumed together with an allergen, a reaction can occur. Or if we ingest foods that stimulate the degranulation of mast cells and the consequence is the release of histamine. It is not a immune reaction, because it is not the immune system that reacts but these foods already contain vasoactive amines. She will not ask all the foods cited in the slides, they are only added for our interest. Now there are very good tests to detect lactose intolerance: breath test in which you measure hydrogen produced by respiration. The lactose is not broken down so it is fermented by our microbiota so consequently you have bloating, gut pain and diarrhea. The lactose intolerance incidence is 30-40% but it is important the degree of severity. Another intolerance due to enzymatic mechanisms is the intolerance to ethanol: ladies are much less tolerant to alcohol than men because they have 30% less alcohol dehydrogenase in the stomach. Eastern people do not tolerate alcohol like western people because they have different isotypes of alcohol dehydrogenase (more active) so they produce more acetaldehyde and less active aldehyde dehydrogenase so the steady state amount of acetaldehyde is higher than western people. Food intolerances of pharmacological type are very frequent. There are foods containing high amounts of vasoactive amines, for instance fermented cheese, milk as well, giving a reaction similar to that occurring in allergies. The difference in the reactions between people is in the ability to eliminate vasoactive amines. Vasoactive amines may trigger the same reactions occurring in allergies. You could become intolerant just once because you ingest too many vasoactive amines: in this case it is an episode, I am not intolerant. The disease condition is when every time I eat, for example, gorgonzola, I am intolerant so it is a disease condition. There are foods able to favor degranulation of mastocytes, so you have a pseudoallergic condition but you do not find antibodies. These are difficult to diagnose, usually it is used in a food diary. In addition there are some foods that are inhibitors of the normal catabolism of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), so inhibitors of monoaminoxidase, and in the case of histamine inhibition of diamine oxidase. Often the situation is complex so you have bigger content of vasoactive amines and also presence of inhibitors of amine catabolism and eventually in the case of histamine and serotonin, the catabolism leads to the production of imidazole acetate that means that aldehyde dehydrogenase is important. So the best competitive inhibitor of diamine oxidase or monoamine oxidase, meaning a good substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase is alcohol. If I eat food rich in histamine and I drink alcohol I impari the histamine removal and I keep the histamine levels high. Finally, the food intolerances could be due to ingestion of food additives: sulphites (present in wine, they are stressors of gastric mucosa), sodium benzoate (probably it causes impairment of vasoactive amines catabolism). Glutamate is still considered as a possible cause of food intolerance but it is still debated. Carolina Gervasio. Fereshteh Tarakemeh 67", "input": "", "output": "Nutritional Diseases\n\n**what should an appropriate diet provide?**\n1. Sufficient energy, in the form of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins; 2. Amino acids and fatty acids to be used as building blocks for synthesis of functional and structural proteins and lipids; 3. Vitamins and minerals, which function as coenzymes or hormones in vital metabolic pathways or as important structural components (Calcium).\n\n**what are primary and secondary malnutrition?**\nPrimary malnutrition: is insufficient intake of one or more of the components an appropriate diet should have (sufficient calories, sufficient proteins and fats, and sufficient vitamins and minerals) Secondary malnutrition: nutrient intake is adequate, but malnutrition is the result of malabsorption, impaired utilization or storage, excess loss, or increased need for nutrients.\n\n**what conditions may lead to primary malnutrition?**\npoverty lack of education anorexia/bulimia nervosa chronic alcoholism pharmacological therapies advanced cancer gastrointestinal pathologies\n\n**what are the major diseases and conditions that lead to secondary**\nmalnutrition? secondary malnutrition often develops in chronically ill, elderly, and bedridden patients. >50% of older residents in nursing homes in the US are malnourished. conditions that may lead to it: Gastric resection → short bowel syndrome IBD or other type of chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa celiac disease lactase deficiency pancreatic insufficiency liver and gallbladder disease → cholestasis\n\n**what is SAM? main characteristics**\nSevere Acute Malnutrition: Inadequate nutrient intake resulting in loss of fat and muscle tissue, weight loss, lethargy, and generalized weakness. in developed countries it is more common in the elderly and debilitated patients in developing countries it affects children (up to 25%) and it is associated with high death rates among the youngest\n\n**How is malnutrition measured?**\nMalnutrition is determined in relation to the body Mass Index (BMI = weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). A BMI of less than 16 kg/m2 is considered malnutrition (the normal range is 18.5 to 25 kg/m2). BMI has its limitations (body builders have a BMI that is considered obese) Other useful parameters are the evaluation of: fat reserves (thickness of skin folds), muscle mass (reduced circumference of the central part of the arm) serum protein (the measurement of albumin and transferrin) gut microbiome\n\n**what are the two protein compartments in the body?**\nTwo differentially regulated protein compartments in the body: 1) somatic compartment(proteins in skeletal muscles) 2) visceral compartment (protein stores in the visceral organs, primarily the liver)\n\n**Describe Marasmus**\nMarasmus is a severe type of malnutrition characterized by an overall caloric deficiency (with or without protein deficiency) Usually affects children in developing countries Weight is 60% of normal weight for age and sex. (Low BMI) There is growth retardation, anemia, severe fat loss, severe sarcopenia, impaired immunity. The somatic reserve of protein is almost completely depleted whereas the visceral reserve is not completely depleted so serum albumin is normal or slightly below normal\n\n**Describe Kwashiorkor**\nKwashiorkor is the most common SAM in African children. It results from a severe protein deficiency that is relatively more severe than the total calorie deficiency. It results from a diet that is almost exclusive in carbohydrates. The protein deficiency is so extreme that both the somatic and visceral reserves of protein are depleted, causing severe hypoalbuminemia that results in edema (ascites) so they have a swollen stomach that “hides” the malnourished appearance. Fat deposits are maintained, muscle atrophy is less marked (or visible, probably because of glycogen) than in marasmus. Less severe forms can be seen in individuals with chronic diarrheal states\n\n**What are the effects of Marasmus and Kwashiorkor in the bone marrow?**\nThere’s usually hypoplasia in the bone marrow.\n\n**This is due to a lack of nutrients for the synthesis of red and white blood cells.**\nThe peripheral blood commonly reveals mild to moderate anemia Depending on the specific type of deficiency or the combination of deficiencies (iron, folate, vitamin B12, protein, etc), the type of anemia that is going to be present (normocytic, microcytic or macrocytic).\n\n**What are the effects of Marasmus and Kwashiorkor in the brain? The brain in infants who are born to malnourished mothers and who suffer SAM during the first 1 or 2 years of life has been reported by some to show cerebral atrophy, a reduced number of neurons, and impaired myelinization of white matter.**\n\n**Define cachexia**\nSAM is a common complication in patients with AIDS or advanced cancers → cachexia. Cachexia occurs in about 50% of cancer patients, most commonly in individuals with gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and lung cancers (responsible for about 30% of cancer deaths). Highly debilitating condition characterized by: Extreme weight loss 1. 2. Fatigue 3. Muscle atrophy (Mortality is generally the consequence of atrophy of the diaphragm) 4. Anemia 5. Anorexia 6. Edema.\n\n**It is a result of a combination of factors including:**\n1. Energy waste through the use of metabolically inefficient pathways (anaerobic metabolism and cori cycle) 2. Anorexia due to Endocrine imbalance Cytokines Psychological factors (depression, stress) Taste disruptions 3. tumor-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction (decreased peristalsis, decreased digestive secretions, delayed digestion and assimilation of nutrients) 4. proteolysis due to activation of NFkB and transcription of muscle- specific ubiquitin ligase 5.\n\n**describe vitamin A function and deficiency**\nVitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin absorbed as preformed VitA from animal products or as carotenes from vegetal sources, which are then converted into the active vitamin (retinol). Main functions: 1. Maintenance of normal vision (trans retinal in rhodopsin) 2. Cell growth and mainteinance of the differentiation of epithelial cells (important in the differentiation of the muco-secreting epithelium) 3. Metabolic effects (e.g. drug metabolism, fatty acids…) 4. Stimulation of the immune system 5. Photoprotection 6. Antioxidant\n\n**Deficiency may be casued by undernutrition or fat malabsorption.**\nConsequences of deficiency (symptoms) are: impaired vision esp. at night epithelial metaplasia and keratinization respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin.. Eye: squamous metaplasia of the epithelium of the conjunctiva and lacrimal ducts → xeroftalmia (dry eye) → Bitot spots (keratin spots) → keratomalacia (cornea erosion that may lead to blindness)\n\n**describe the main steps of vitamin D metabolism**\n1. The skin synthesizes 90% of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) from 7- dehydrocholesterol in a reaction that requires UVB. There are dietary sources of cholecalciferol that account for around 10% of our normal intake (milk products and fish) 2. Vit D3 binds DBP (D binding protein) and is taken to the liver 3. In the liver cholecalciferol is converted to a more active form 25- hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D) by 25-hydrolases (CYP27A1, and other CYPs) 4. in the kidneys 20-OH-D is converted to the most active form of the vitamin: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by a 1-alpha-hydrolase.\n\n****\n\n**what are the functions of vitamin D?**\nMain functions of vitamin D: Maintains adequate plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus: Stimulation of intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus Stimulation of calcium reabsorption in the kidney Induces Osteoclast maturation (osteoclasts dissolve bone and release calcium and phosphorus into the circulation) → Key role of parathyroid glands → ↑PTH Bone mineralization Antimicrobial effects Involved in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis\n\n**Describe vitamin D deficiency**\nnormal levels in the blood: 20-100 ng/ml; deficit <20ng/ml Causes: Limited exposure to sunlight Dietary deficiencies Kidney or liver disorders, malabsorption… Aging, genetic osteoporosis\n\n**→ Consequences of VitD deficiency are hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia that lead to low bone mineralization.**\nIn growing children whose epiphyses have not closed, this leads to Rickets: Inadequate calcification leads to excessive growth of the epiphyseal cartilage → microfractures → skeletal deformation (arching of the legs). Square shape of the head due to flattening of the occipital bones and deformation of the parietal ones. Anterior protrusion of the sternum (pigeon breast deformity). In Adults, Osteomalacia: defective bone remodeling that increases risk for fractures especially in vertebrae and femur. More rarely, there can be hypocalcemic tetany: Convulsive state caused by an insufficient extracellular concentration of ionized calcium, which is required for normal neural excitation and the relaxation of muscles.\n\n**Describe the function of vitamin C**\nVitamin C (ascorbic acid) is water soluble, obtained entirely from diet. It’s main functions: is a cofactor for enzymes that hydroxylate procollagen into collagen and participate in wound healing Antioxidant properties Facilitates intestinal absorption of iron\n\n**describe vitamin C deficiency**\nThe main consequence is impaired collagen formation which results in bleeding easily, and impaired wound healing. Inadequately hydroxylated procollagen cannot acquire a stable helical configuration, so it is poorly secreted from the fibroblast. Effects: It affects particularly blood vessels → predisposition to hemorrhages and poor wound healing.. Loss of teeth and gums. In children: insufficient growth and abnormal development of collagen-containing structures (teeth, bones and blood vessels). Inability to contain infections. Iron deficiency anemia Cause: inadequate diet. It was common between sailors between 16th and 18th century (>2 million died)\n\n**what is the role of vitamin B12?**\nVitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin required for the development, myelination, and function of the central nervous system; healthy red blood cell formation; and DNA synthesis. Methylcobalamin (metabolically active form of vitamin B12) is an essential cofactor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase: methylcobalamin yields a methyl group that is recovered from N5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, the principal form of folic acid in plasma, which is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid (FH4). In that cycle it is helping to form FH4 and methionine. FH4 is required for the conversion of deoxy-uridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), a building block for DNA.\n\n****\n\n**how is vitamin B12 absorbed?**\nVitamin B12 (cobalamin) is taken up with the diet (foods of animal origin) and synthesized by the intestinal flora (daily requirement is 2 to 3 µg). Absorption occurs in the terminal ileum, where the receptors for the vitamin B12 / IF complex are expressed (cubilin). Vitamin B12 is freed from binding proteins (in food) through the action of pepsin in the stomach and binds to a salivary protein called haptocorrin. In the duodenum, bound vitamin B12 is released from haptocorrin by the action of pancreatic proteases and it associates with intrinsic factor (F1), produced by the parietal cells of the fundic mucosa. In the blood the vitamin B12 is transported by a group of proteins (transcobalamin)\n\n**describe vitamin B12 deficiency**\nIneffective hematopoioesis: Deficit in folic acid or vitamin B12 causes altered DNA synthesis: delayed nuclear maturation, normal cytoplasmic and hemoglobin → nuclear to cytoplasm asynchrony. DNA defects trigger apoptosis of precursors inside the marrow leading to pancytopenia (low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) Formation of large erythroid precursors (megaloblasts) in the bone marrow The erythrocytes that manage to leave the marrow are typically macrocytic. Vitamin B12 deficiency in most cases is secondary to lack of intrinsic factor (F1). PERNICIOUS ANEMIA: Autoimmune disease, characterized by the presence of auto-Ab that attack on the gastric mucosa (anti-parietal cells or anti-F1 or anti-ileal receptor).\n\n**what are the 3 different types of adverse reactions to food?**\n1. TOXIC (INTOXICATIONS) 2. NON TOXIC 1. DUE TO ALTERED IMMUNE RESPONSE (ALLERGIES) 1. IgE dependent 2. non IgE dependent 2. NOT OF IMMUNOLOGIC ORIGIN (INTOLERANCES) 1. of enzymatic type 2. of pharmacologic type 3. induced by food additives\n\n**describe intoxications**\nThere is not any distinction among individuals so the toxin hit all of us. There are different types of toxins: from funghi like Amanita phalloides, Amanita verna, Amanita virosa which may be fatal; Inadequate food storage can allow the growth of dangerous microorganisms (contaminants) e.g. aspergillus which produces aflatoxins. Chronic consumption of these contaminats is carcinogenic. More common and frequent are intoxications because of Clostridium Botulinum, Staphylococcus Aureus and Salmonella Typhi.\n\n**what are the food allergies?**\nFood allergies can be IgE mediated and non-IgE mediated. The symptoms in IgE mediated allergies appear within minutes to hours. The reaction is fast, acute, sometimes very strong as in the case of anaphylaxis. Allergies not mediated by IgE, but still mediated by improper reaction of the innate immunity, show a late onset of symptoms. there is an increasing number of conditions characterized by both IgE and non IgE mediated symptoms that appear fast and last for hours or days.\n\n**describe IgE-mediated food allergy**\nType I hypersensitivities include atopic diseases, which are an exaggerated IgE mediated immune responses (i.e., allergic: asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and dermatitis), and allergic diseases, which are immune responses to foreign allergens (i.e., anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, food, and drug allergies). The allergens that result in a type I hypersensitivity may be harmless (i.e., pollen, mites, or foods, drugs, etc.) or more hazardous such as insect venoms. The reaction may be manifested in different areas of the body and may result in instances such as: Nasal allergic rhinitis or hay fever Ocular allergic conjunctivitis, potentially due to seasonal allergens such as pollen or mold spores Dermatological hives, atopic eczema, or erythema Soft tissue angioedema Pulmonary reactions, such as allergic asthma or hypoxia Systemic reaction, which is a life-threatening medical emergency, and also known as anaphylaxis. There are common environmental allergens that are known to be trigger excessive formation of IgE antibodies in some individuals: e.g. pollen, moulds, mites, foods (eggs, crustaceans, fish, fruit), etc. Having a hypersensitivity reaction to these common environmental allergens is also an important risk factor for the development of allergic diseases (IgE mediated): rhinitis, asthma, atopic eczema, etc. The risk of developing food allergy can depend on several factors: Hereditary predisposition to express hypersensitivity to foods with a high protein content (mainly of plant origin); over time these individuals may develop other allergic pathologies (atopic rhinitis, bronchial asthma) Increased intestinal mucosal permeability (physiological in childhood, pathological due to inflammatory processes or malnutrition) can favor the penetration of antigens and their presentation to lymphocytes Allergen concentration Environmental factors (cigarette smoke, physical stress, cold temperatures)\n\n**describe the sequence of events in immediate (type 1) hypersensitivity allergens start the first phase of sensitization of cells, in particular mastocytes and basophils that start expressing on the surface IgE and it is only the second encounter with the same or similar allergen because of the reaction of IgE on the surface of the cell, there is a massive, acute release of inflammatory mediators like histamine and prostaglandins that cause the allergic reaction which leads to local and systemic symptoms in particular conjunctivitis, nasal allergy, asthma, urticaria.**\n\n**describe non IgE mediated allergies (type 2 hypersensitivities)**\nnon IgE mediated allergies: There is involvement of innate immunity, as well as the adaptive immunity, in particular Th2 cells. (Th1 is mainly leading to activation of cytotoxic T cells response while Th2 response, typical of allergies, is producing antibodies.) Food protein induced Enteropathies: Food-Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), Food-Protein-Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP), Food Protein Enteropthy (FPE) ****they occur very early in the childhood and are characterized by abnormal innate immune responses to some protein content of a given food. Eosinophilic GI disorders: esophagitis, gastritis, enterocolitis. Mixed condition in which IgE is present as well. Celiac Disease\n\n**describe celiac disease**\nwhat it is: Non IgE-dependent Immune-mediated disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten containing foods such as wheat, rye, or barley in genetically predisposed individuals → intestinal villous atrophy. Symptoms: vary and may include digestive problems, anemia, skin rash, and joint and bone pain. It may also be asymptomatic or present with atypical symptoms and escape diagnosis for a long time anemia due to chronic iron and vitamin malabsorption. ■ Silent celiac disease (positive serology and villous atrophy without symptoms); ■ latent celiac disease (positive serology is not accompanied by villous atrophy). Epidemiology: Incidence: 1/100-1/150 In adults, most commonly between the ages of 30 and 60. Possible association with other autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) Treatment: gluten-free diet. Morphology: increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) epithelial proliferation with crypt elongation. villous atrophy Diagnosis: endoscopy and biopsy → altered small intestine mucosa, sometimes lymphocytic infiltration (1st degree of CD) or already damaged villi. Serum Ab: IgA anti-Transglutaminase, IgG anti- Transglutaminase, IgA anti-endomisium.\n\n**Describe the physic pathology of celiac disease**\nGluten is digested into amino acids and peptides, including a 33-a.a. gliadin, a peptide that is resistant to degradation by gastric, pancreatic, and small intestine proteases. ❖ Indigestible fragments of gluten induce enterocytes to release the zonulin which loosens tight junctions. ❖ Gliadin crosses the intestinal lining and accumulate under the enterocytes. ❖ Gliadin induces enterocytes to secrete IL-15, which in turn triggers activation and proliferation of CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). ❖ IELs express NKG2D, a natural killer marker and receptor for MIC-A. Enterocytes that have been induced to express surface MIC-A in response to stress are then attacked. The resulting epithelial damage enhance the passage of other gliadin peptides into the lamina propria where they are deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG), an enzyme released by the damaged cells. ❖ The deamidated gliadin interacts with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 on antigen presenting cells (APC) and in turn stimulates CD4+ T cells to produce cytokines that exacerbate tissue damage. ❖ B cells release antibody molecules targeted to gluten and TTG. Those antibodies might cause further damage when they hit their targets on near enterocytes.\n\n**describe food intolerances of enzymatic type**\nThe most notable one is lactose intolerance, caused by a deficiency in the enzyme lactase (a hydrolase) that hydrolyzes the beta 1,4 glycosidic bond between glucose and galactose in lactose. Diagnosed early in life but can also occur in adults (one third of adults have reduced lactase activity). As a result, lactose remains in the gut and being osmotically active it draws in excess water → diarrhea the enterocytes cannot absorb the sugar and it is instead fermented by gut bacteria → gas, bloating and intestinal pain.\n\n**Describe food intolerances of pharmacological type**\nresult from pharmacological effects of vasoactive amines present in foods. Histamine , tyramine, putrescine, spermine, spermidine, and cadaverine, are compounds formed during microbial fermentation of certain foods so they naturally contain high levels of biogenic amines. These include: cheeses (especially ripe cheeses– “cheese-reaction”), wine, kefir, dry sausage, fermented meats, sauerkraut, mushrooms, miso and soy sauce, chocolate and yeast (see links at bottom of page). Sensitivity to histamine varies widely between individuals. Normally biogenic amines are rapidly broken down by enzymes. Some drugs inhibit the action of the enzymes. These include some antibiotics and antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Other drugs promote histamine release from immune cells, including some opioids, muscle relaxants, x-ray contrast media, as well as alcohol. Ingestion of TYRAMINE (E and NE precursor)with food should be limited to a minimum when taking MAO inhibitors due to risk of severe arterial hypertension Symptoms can be a burning or itching sensation in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, flushing, skin rash or hives, itching, diarrhea, headache, blood pressure changes (both high or low possible), dizziness, problems with concentration, “mental fog” and fainting. The usual onset of symptoms is within a few minutes after ingestion of the offending food. Some cases of asthma may be attributable to histamine intolerance. The duration of symptom ranges from a few hours to 24 h. Normally no specific treatment is required, as symptoms subside spontaneously. “They’re re very frequent. 1. Foods containing vasoactive amines: Foods containing high amounts of vasoactive amines, for instance fermented cheese, milk as well, may cause a reaction similar to that occurring in allergies. The difference in the reactions between people is in the ability to eliminate vasoactive amines. There can also be single episodes of apparent intolerances when consuming these foods excessively: in this case it is an episode, the person is not intolerant if this doesn’t happen every time they consume these foods. 2. Foods that cause degranulation of mastocytes: pseudoallergic condition (without antibodies). These are difficult to diagnose. 3. foods that maintain levels of histamine and serotonin higher because they are inhibitors of their normal catabolism (natural MAO inhibitors and diamine oxidase inhibitors)\n\n**Often the situation is complex so you have bigger content of**\nvasoactive amines and also presence of inhibitors of amine catabolism and eventually in the case of histamine and serotonin, the catabolism leads to the production of imidazole acetate that means that aldehyde dehydrogenase is important. So the best competitive inhibitor of diamine oxidase or monoamine oxidase, meaning a good substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase is alcohol. If I eat food rich in histamine and I drink alcohol, I impair the histamine removal and I keep the histamine levels high.\n\n**Describe intolerances to food additives**\nsulphites (present in wine, they are stressors of gastric mucosa), sodium benzoate (probably it causes impairment of vasoactive amines catabolism). Glutamate is still considered as a possible cause of food intolerance but it is still debated."}

Aging is not a disease, but rather a physiological process. Of course, we must distinguish between premature aging and healthy and successful aging. economic and social affairs, between two main years, fig.1 2019 and 2050. The estimated increase in the number of people aged 65 years and over has been depicted in the third column. In Asia, Northern Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa the expected percentage increase in the elderly population is quite amazing: over 200%. We already know that Asia will overcome the other countries. You can spot the data concerning Europe and Northern America, where the increase in about 30 years is expected to be some, but not much (less than 50% of the present elderly population). fig.2 Concerning Italy in particular, we may use as a reference the data provided by the European Political Cooperation in 2018 about the life expectancy at birth (fig. 3): as we can see, the mean life expectancy is different in males and females, because the ladies have a greater life expectancy (more or less 5 years more). This is still true for the life expectancy at 65 years old. Of course, the numbers are reduced, but the overall numbers are the ones I just mentioned: 82.5 for males and 86.9 for females. The important thing is not the average life expectancy, which is increasing, but the point is the quality. Different subgroups of people in different regions of the world can face social and economical problems. We should do our best to improve the quality of our life. Aging in a successful way is the only way to go on living. These data are solid, so they can give us an overall picture of the whole story. So, we must pay attention to these data, in order to plan a number of actions from the socio-economic and sanitary point of views. Eleonora Deinite 42 08.05.2023 POLI fig.3 What is aging?AGING = the physiological process characterized by the progressive and continuous loss of function of cells, tissues, organs and systems with time. Aging is influenced by genetics but especially by the environment. Physiological, pathological and environmental factors can affect our personal way to age. Aging is a:\n\n**multifactorial condition, as health(we need different factors to be and remain healthy) and many diseases:**the main human diseases are non-communicable diseases (namely, most diseases except for infections, such as cardiovascular diseases, most cancers, gastro-intestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, etc. i.e. all those diseases that can’t be contagious). In these diseases, many factors contribute to pathogenesis. It may seem a stupid thing, but in reality it is very important, especially as physicians: when we are facing a non-communicable disease in a patient, we must be aware that many factors can cause it. I have to consider the different factors actually present in that particular patient.\n\n**multi-stepprocess. There is not a single step:**for example, you don’t suddenly have diabetes: you have first hyperglycemia, then the symptomatic disease, finally eventual complications. In the same way, we don’t age all of a sudden.\nMulti-factorial and multi-step processes characterize both health and aging. There are many theories on the reason why people age, because there are many different factors to include (fig. 4). The funnel gives you the idea of the multistep and multifactorial progressive process of aging, where different factors get in, not necessarily at the same time (rarely they are simultaneous). Eleonora Deinite 43 08.05.2023 POLI In the progress of aging, familiarity (inherited conditions) plays a role, but often familiarity is overwhelmed by many other factors. In the past, hereditary factors played a much larger role, while nowadays the progeny of those who died prematurely of heart attack (due to inherited cardiovascular diseases predisposition) can reach up to 70-80 years of age, despite having inherited the same genetic factors that killed their parents. This is due to a change in the environment, modern medicine and improved healthcare systems, which made a difference. So, familiarity is important, but it is not all. If in the family of a patient there is the predisposition for fig.4 diabetes, it’s not said that the patient will develop diabetes, it depends on them, because, although they have familiarity, they can avoid all the other factors that can cause diabetes. For example, during WWII, “diabetes didn't exist”, because people couldn't eat properly. The other factors can be:\n\n**environment, as in the case of pollution**\n\n**radiation**\n\n**smoking**\n\n**nutrition**\nDue to these factors, we have eventually altered proteins. To have altered proteins, we need to modify the genes through mutations induced by the environment and epigenetic changes. So, the enzymes and the structural proteins that make up cells, tissues and organs do not work properly. So, there is a progressive alteration of structure and function of cells, tissues and organs. We have an increase in cell death, tissue damage, repair, inflammation (which is an incredibly strong tool to make a disease progress). General pathology(which should be called “environmental pathology”) doesn't focus on a single disease or a single class of diseases but, given a certain disease, it analyzes from the very beginning the causes, the development, the expression and the complications of the disease. So, the whole story of the disease is important. If you look in this way at a given disease, you have an overall idea of the disease: you can understand what each step means, what multifactorial means and so on. There are also other aspects that contribute to the progression of aging:\n\n**mitochondrial dysfunction**\n\n**oxidative stress**\n\n**depletion of staminal cells**\n\n**cellular senescence**\n! Aging and senescence are not synonyms. They are close, but they are not the same thing.\n\n**altered intercellular communication**\n\n**altered efficacy of nutrients**\nAltogether these factors, possibly in a synergistic way, amplify the pathology and eventually affect aging, which is Eleonora Deinite 44 08.05.2023 POLI normal, but can be either better or worse aging. In case of worse aging, the \"pre-room\" is called frailty. Why do people age? There are many theories, and no single theory adequately explains the aging progress:\n\n**Hereditary factors**\n\n**Loss of cellular mass and ability of cells to divide and replicate**\n\n**Accumulation of waste materials that clog cells and cause them to die**\n\n**Changes in structure of connective tissue**\n\n**Oxidative stress**\nPhysical changes related to “normal” aging are not a disease and occur in most body systems, including: SENSORY SYSTEM\n\n**Loss of some of the features of vision**\nacuity → cataracts, macular degeneration accommodation → presbyopia(physiological insufficiency of accommodation associated with the aging of the eye that results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects) peripheral vision → glaucoma = pattern of diseases due to changes in the optic nerve, which is typical in elderly people and causes the partial or complete loss of vision (blindness), especially of peripheral vision dark adaptation contrast sensitivity\n\n**Auditory and vestibular apparati**\nPresbycusis(or age-related hearing loss) = cumulative effect of aging on hearing → high frequency hearing loss vestibular dysfunction\n\n**Oral/dental apparatus**\n40% of elderly are edentulous (= having no teeth) alteration in taste and salivary function CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\n\n**There are people reaching 80 years of age that have fantastic brains, but after this age the number of neurodegenerations increases significantly, although many people over 80 years of age still drive.**\n\n**Maybe we can significantly notice a slower development and activation of the different aspects of intelligence due to increased “lag” time of neurons transmitting information (slowing manifests itself in the learning process). Unfamiliar or high stress activities cause an older person to perform more slowly. So, we have a gradual reduction of functions, so you need more time to get fit on intellectual activities, but eventually you do them.**\n\n**The memory is good, but maybe the activity of the memory is lower, so you need more time to memorize things, but eventually you memorize perfectly. In particular, due to the stored memory, if you are lucky enough to not get a neurodegeneration, you can even get a better performance, because of the experience you stored that helps you (problem solving skill increases with age), but you need time.**\n\n**It’s important to minimize distractions, because older people lose the ability to perform multitasking activities, although they can still perform monotasking activities one by one.**\n\n**“Use it or lose it”**\nEleonora Deinite 45 08.05.2023 POLI MUSCLES AND BONES\n\n**The reduction of muscle mass, function and strength is normal if it is moderate (below 20-30%), otherwise, if you get an exaggerated (not normal and consequently pathological) reduction of muscle, you get into sarcopenia (from the Greek, “loss of flesh, meat, muscle”) = depletion of muscle mass (there is a 30% loss in muscle mass from 3rd to 8th decade).**\n\n**The ladies, after menopause, could suffer a significant reduction in bone mass and density. The bones lose calcium and other minerals.**\n\n**Osteoarthritis= a type of degenerative joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone.**\n\n**There are many ways to keep the muscles fit, to keep a good density of the bones, especially appropriate physical exercise at appropriate times, diet and adequate rest.**\nDIGESTIVE SYSTEM\n\n**Heart/circulatory system**\n\n**It is less fit and less efficient in time:**\nAge changes make the heart less able to pump efficiently Less blood pumped results in lowered blood oxygen levels Blood vessels lose elasticity with age so heart has to pump harder to circulate blood\n\n**There are many reasons:**the main reason is atherosclerosis, that you already know, since you studied atherogenesis (the mechanism of formation of atherosclerosis).\n\n**The vascular changes include:**\nloss of the elastic fibers in the arterial vessel walls increase in the number of connective fibers decrease in the number of vascular smooth muscles → the vascular smooth muscle cells are \"convinced\" by different molecules, usually pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic molecules, to change their phenotype to become fibroblast-like cells. increased thickness of intima and media → the arterial vessel wall increases in size and protrudes in the direction of the lumen collagen deposition, increased fibronectin, cross linking (AGEs), fragmentation of elastin and calcium deposition in the matrix The net result is increased vascular stiffness. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\n\n**The blood oxygenation of an elder person is often a lot, but it is less efficient, because there is less oxygen in the blood per unit of time.**\n\n**The amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream and the rate of blood flow decline with age.**\n\n**Even with the lung capacity remaining normal, the lung tissues seem to lose facility for making the oxygen-to- blood transfer.**\n\n**Since older people can not breath as fast, there is less oxygen entering the blood per minute.**\nRENAL SYSTEM • The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a parameter evaluated in a standard blood analysis you can ask for your patients. ! This rate is normally decreasing a bit within a moderate range: Eleonora Deinite 46 08.05.2023 POLI GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM “For many years I was able to digest stones”, but as the time goes by the situation is gradually changing, because there is a decrease in: ■GI absorptive cells ■GI motility ■Sphincter activity\n\n**There are people who never suffered from GERD (gastro-esophageal reflux disease) and now**\nthey do, because the activity of the cardias sphincter activity is not as good as before. There are also dietary and lifestyle conditions affecting the sphincter activity, not only the number of years. It is a complex process. ■GI blood flow ■gastric acid secretion ■active transport ! When you face a definite disease, keep your vision wide and open. At first, you must have a general idea of the individual and then you can focus on the particular disease. The age-associated factors can be more or less amplified in different people, since it depends on the number and the synergistic activity of the factors occurring in that particular individual. 47 Aging is not usually a disease, since we can also hope for a healthy and successful aging, but aging could also be a disease, so it can be worse than expected for many reasons. Eleonora Deinite 08.05.2023 POLI FRAILTY\n\n**is a precondition of bad aging (aging as a disease)**\n→ It is essential to recognise and, if possible, to prevent the progression of frailty ! Aging is a multi-step process\n\n**is an age-related state of high vulnerability to adverse health outcomes after a stressor event, so is a reduced healthy adaptation to stress**\n→ some people after a certain age are less able to adapt, because the adaptation mechanisms are lacking and/or defective\n\n**is characterized by a reduced capacity to compensate aging-related molecular and cellular damage**\n\n**predisposes the individuals to progressive decline in different functional domains**\n\n**contributes to the onset of geriatric syndromes**\nThis cartoon (fig. 6) well describes the difference between successful aging (healthy condition) and bad aging, which can lead to frailty and to disability. Usually, they have the same pattern up to 75 years of age, but some people can have a successful aging up to 80-95 years of age too (of course, it is important to prevent and cure neurodegenerative diseases to reach this goal). But you can have frailty and disability well before the expected 80 years of age. Frailty is a clinical syndrome now well fig.6 recognised by physicians that marks decreased physiologic reserve and resilience. Frailty involves a vicious cycle culminating in disability and/or mortality. A list of the main symptoms is present → a person is frail if they are showing some or all of the symptoms reported in the list→ substantial evidence that frailty is an independent, distinct, clinically recognizable entity. SYMPTOMS OF FRAILTY There are different symptoms of frailty,depending on the confluence of two or more of these symptoms, you can have a different degree (moderate, heavy frailty):\n\n**sarcopenia**\nA frail person shows you first of all a sarcopenic condition, due to many different causes (fig. 7): ■the primary cause of sarcopenia is aging ■disease → inflammation in particular ■inactivity→ due to sedentary lifestyle, for example ■malnutrition\n\n**undernutrition**\n\n**overnutrition → sarcopenic obesity (it can be a secondary cause of sarcopenia) → the obese people are often sarcopenic, becasue instead of having the development of muscles, they develop fat**\nEleonora Deinite 48 08.05.2023 POLI fig.7\n\n**inflammation**\n! It is the most important factor in disease progression. If you want to stop or decrease the progression of any non-communicable diseases, you must stop inflammation.\n\n**decreased heart rate variability**\n\n**altered clotting processes**\n\n**increased insulin resistance→ increased glycemia**\n\n**anemia = a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the hemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal.**\nin thalassemia, you have very small red blood cells (microcytic anemia) and there is a higher number of red blood cells → we normally have 4.35 to 5.65 million RBCs per microliter (µL) of blood for men and 3.92 to 5.13 million RBCs per µL of blood for women.Since the RBCs are smaller, there is less hemoglobin in the blood, less oxygen to the tissue and so on. To recognise an anemia, you must measure the hemoglobin content of blood by evaluating the hematocrit (the ratio of the volume of red blood cells to the total volume of blood),because it’s important to have a sufficient mass of RBCs (either smaller or bigger, it doesn’t count) that can convey in a minute the right amount of oxygen in the periphery. In an anemic person, if you check the blood analysis, you must look at the hemoglobin content first: the hemoglobin content is correct when it is 13.2 to 16.6 grams per deciliter for men, and 11.6 to 15 grams per deciliter for women. Hemoglobin level and hematocrit are the two important parameters to check to see if you have a normal hematological condition.\n\n**altered hormones**\nThere are endocrinological problems due to the decline of estrogen and testosterone levels with age ■decrease in DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), which is a steroid produced in the adrenal gland and is a precursor of testosterone and estrogen ■decrease in IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) ■decrease in cortisol\n\n**micronutrient deficiencies**\nCONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY What are the consequences of the frail condition? disability and dependency - slow and incomplete recovery from a given disease, like infections → they can hardly manage Sars-COV2, for example - increase in the frequency of falls Eleonora Deinite 49 08.05.2023 POLI increase in mortality - adverse outcomes of hospitalization CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IN AGING =INFLAMMAGING In frail people, usually serum plasma markers of inflammation are statistically increased (fig. 8): a typical serum marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CPR), is increased. fig.8 Inflammation is a bad companion for aging and for cholesterol: without inflammation, cholesterol doesn't not accumulate in the blood vessels; you need inflammation in the endothelial barrier, which can be caused by hypertension, hyperglycemia, smoking etc. These factors make cholesterol aggressive because of inflammation, because the endothelial barrier changes its phenotype from normal to inflammatory. So, inflammaging is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, dementia etc. For example, inflammation makes a difference in the cancerogenesis, starting from a single clone of neoplastic cells to the actual symptomatic occurence of the disease. Cancerogenesis is a long story that does not necessarily end in a bad way. Inflammaging is a term invented by an Italian pathologist that is now used worldwide. Chronic inflammation makes aging pathological and more complicated. Inflammaging = a condition characterized by elevated levels of blood inflammatory markers in the serum and in the brain that carries high susceptibility to chronic morbidity, disability, frailty, and premature death. It has been proposed as a marker of the loss of glucose in the urine (glycosuria). These are the two main symptoms of diabetes to make the lab analyses. But not all diabetic people are at the same stage of the disease: there are people with mild hyperglycemia, other people are blind, other fig.9 accelerated aging , but it is not only related to aging (fig. 9). For example, if a patient has diabetes mellitus, the symptoms of this disease are hyperglycemia and, if hyperglycemia is more than 180 mg/100 ml, people suffer from heart attacks because of the diabetes… so, there are different steps of the disease (diabetes is multistep and multifactorial). In the scheme, the cause leads to the disease (diabetes mellitus), which shows some symptoms (like hyperglycemia) and can then reach the complete expression of the disease and the complications (blindness, kidney failure, heart failure etc.). Eleonora Deinite 50 08.05.2023 POLI Inflammation has two main roles:\n\n**it favors the action of the causes of the disease and promotes the occurrence of the disease → contribution to the disease appearance (promotion)**\n\n**when inflammation becomes a sustained process, it becomes a factor of progression of the disease → the disease is already present, but the inflammation further stimulates the disease → enhancement of disease development (progression)**\nThis difference is very important also in carcinogenesis:\n\n**promotion → a small clone of neoplastic cells will be destroyed in 99,99% of the cases by our defenses, but if**\nthere is an inflammatory process to improve and stimulate the growth of this small clone, the latter will grow and won’t be small anymore, so our defenses will be overwhelmed.\n\n**progression → if the disease is already present, for example, you can have a metastasis, inflammation can enhance the progression of the disease.**\nFor this reason, prevention is very important: if I stop the disease at the beginning is a whole different story than if I act when the disease has already progressed much. MECHANISMS OF INFLAMMAGING fig.10 Inflammaging occurs through different mechanisms → Why does 1+1 not necessarily give 2 in this case? Because not all mechanisms occur and not all mechanisms occur at the same time. 1.genetic susceptibility → Probably acquired factors rather than genetic predisposition are making the difference Various data indicate that genetic variability affects the plasma levels of several inflammatory markers. The cumulative effect of these genetic polymorphisms might be a risk factor for multimorbidity and frailty. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (fig. 10) are positions in the genome where the large majority of individuals have for example an Adenine (A) while other subjects have a Guanine (G) or a Thymine (T). Not all the single nucleotide changes are classified as SNPs, only those present in at least 1% of the population. When we can have a different combination of different SNPs so that some people age more easily than others. It is a problem of accumulation of SNPs. 2.central obesity = accumulation of excessive fat around stomach and abdomen We have two types of adipose tissues:\n\n**brown adipose tissue**\n\n**white adipose tissue**\n  \n  \n  \npresence of adrenergic receptors on these adipocytes abdominal area (visceral and retroperitoneal areas) sort of “endocrine system”can produce inflammation and other bioactive all over the body, according to sexual differences, subcutaneous localization, is devoted prevalently to produce heat (caloric energy), molecules fig.11 Eleonora Deinite 51 08.05.2023 POLI → it’s better to not accumulate white adipose tissue, especially with age - in women, after menopause, since estrogen cannot limit anymore white adipose tissue accumulation - after 70 years of age, almost all menhave a big abdomen White adipose tissue can produce a lot of molecules, which are called altogether adipokines (fig. 12): the scheme shows only the main ones, because probably we don’t even know all the molecules produced by our central (white) adipose tissue. If a person has an excessive amount of white adipose tissue, they are always producing these molecules. If you have any inflammatory process going on, that process will be amplified by these molecules. This is the reason why obesity and overweight are associated with all the diseases that can be stimulated (either promotion or progression) by inflammation.\n\n**pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and IL-6)**\n\n**MCP-1 (macrophage chemotactic protein 1)**\n\n**TNF-ɑ**\nis a pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulates insulin resistance, with the support of macrophages infiltrating in the tissue, since macrophages produce resistin, which induces insulin resistance (this causes hyperglycemia)\n\n**PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1)**\nplasminogen activator produces plasmin (or fibrinolysin), which induces the lysis of fibrin and, consequently, the lysis of blood clots → if you block the production of plasmin, you favor abnormal blood clotting and thrombosis\n\n**angiotensin**\nfavors artery hypertension\n\n**decrease in adiponectin**\ninsulin resistance Q: We said that white adipose tissue is localized in visceral and retroperitoneal areas, does it mean that it is not subcutaneous? Because I know that we have much less brown adipose tissue than white adipose tissue, so isn’t white adipose tissue also subcutaneous? A: The endocrine adipose tissue is localized only in the areas I mentioned, so if you don’t have enough white adipose tissue is alright. In the subcutaneous tissue, you don’t have endocrine activity. These adipocytes have been very well categorized and they only have adrenergic receptors for catecholamines. So, if you feel cold, there is a stress reaction to produce heat. There is a very well known difference. They were asking me yesterday what kind of apolipoproteins were involved in dyslipidemia and I answered both, because it’s better to never be dogmatic. So, I cannot say that in the subcutaneous tissue there is absolutely no production of adipokines, it’s better to say that “to our knowledge” there is no such thing. There is a consensus definition of metabolic syndrome = association of at least three of the following Eleonora Deinite 52 08.05.2023 POLI cardiovascular risk factors. Usually, people with metabolic syndromes are overweight, but it’s never said: in theory, if I see an obese person, I can assume that that person has a metabolic syndrome, because they will be insulin resistant, since they are producing the molecules leading to artery hypertension, hyperglycemia, higher susceptibility to blood clotting and thrombosis. In practice, I should check before making this kind of statement. A.central obesity(abdominal) → it can be measured by many sophisticated systems, but the waist circumference is the most important one: if you pass the limit, you must take action, otherwise you’ll get in troubles\n\n**> 102 cm in men**\n\n**> 88 cm in women**\nB.hypertriglyceridemia\n\n**Dogma:**if you measure twice a fasting glycemia ≥ 150 mg/ml\nC.low hematic HDL levels\n\n**< 40% ml in men**\n\n**< 50% ml in women**\nD.systemic artery hypertension(≥ 130 / ≥ 85 mmHg) E.often characterized by hypercoagulability F.impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) or reduced glucose tolerance\n\n**≥ 110 mg/ml**\nDifference between diseases and syndromes?\n\n**Disease → single cause**\n→ COVID-19 infection is a disease, because it has a single cause\n\n**Syndrome (from the Greek, “run together”) → multiple causes**\n→ I don’t get diabetes if I only have a genetic predisposition to it, I get diabetes if the nutrition is not correct, if there is inflammation etc. (we call diabetes a disease, but it is actually a syndrome) 3.increased gut permeability\n\n**Aging is associated with a reduction of beneficial commensal microorganisms like Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium and Lactobacillus.**\n\n**There are also a few microorganisms that can overgrow in our gut in an improper way:**it’s difficult again to give proper information, but the important thing is that, at the present stage of knowledge of the actual impact of microbiota on our health, we should have a balance in the microbiota. In particular, since there is a high diversity, we should keep this high diversity: a particular clone of bacteria should not be amplified, to maintain a good distribution of microbiota.\nEleonora Deinite 53 08.05.2023 POLI\n\n**Facultative anaerobes such as Fusobacterium and Staphylococcus prevail in the gut of older adults, a status that has been associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in plasma.**\n\n**Increased gut dysbiosis has been postulated to increase mucosal barrier permeability, thereby allowing the entry of bacteria and their products, including pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs), due to the damage of the intestinal epithelial, into the circulatory system. These factors trigger and stimulate inflammatory response because they are recognised by our immune system, where we have receptors, like Toll-like receptors, able to recognise the potential infection. There are a lot of proteins, such as the inflammasome, which are ready to recognise signs of diversity and foreign origin to activate caspase-1 and so on. If some compounds, generated either by the diet or by the microbiota, reach a toxic concentration, the enterocytes die and the tight junctions between the different intestinal epithelial cells become leaky or are destroyed, so the permeability of our semi-permeable intestinal barrier is increased. Gut permeability is crucial.**\n\n**Not only the microbiota affects the gut permeability, also food has a role in it. For example, oxidized cholesterol obtained by the cooking and roasting of cholesterol-containing food causes a great amount of non-enzymatic oxysterols that are then digested, which are not in the good cholesterol enzymatic products I was mentioning before.**\n4.changes to microbiota composition\n\n**The microbiota consists of the assembly of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms Bacteria, Protozoa, Fungi and Viruses.**\n\n**The microbiome refers to the complete genetic material of the microbiota. Compared to the human genome, the human microbiome contains 100 times more genes!**\nThere is an interaction between human genome and microbiome: we don’t know much about it, we have just begun to learn these things. In this field, nutrition is very important: if we feed our microbiota badly or well our microbiota, we must always take into account that our food will have to do with our microbiota. 5.cellular senescence\n\n**A senescent person is a person aging badly or early.**\n\n**Cellular senescence is generally considered to be a pre-encoded cancer suppressor mechanism of altered cell growth characterized by cell cycle arrest, loss of proliferation capacity, increased nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling. Instead of allowing a certain group of cells, maybe stimulated by inflammation, to proceed towards neoplasia, there are mechanisms that our body can implement to make these cells aging and dying early.**\n\n**Cellular senescence includes the action of inflammatory molecules:**one TF important to initiate and sustain the inflammatory response is NF-kB. If you activate NF-kB and the other inflammatory molecules too much, you don’t have a physiological process such as cellular senescence or low inflammatory response, which are good to solve wounds, but you have too much inflammation, which is not good.\nInflammation is physiological only if it is limited in terms of entity and duration. In aging, there is an amplification of the cellular senescence mechanism: in inflammaging there is an excessive inflammation and, consequently, an excessive cellular senescence mechanism. Many age-associated diseases, like cardiovascular diseases, show an excessive activation of this mechanism.\n\n**SNPs located near regulators of senescence and inflammation are particularly associated with diseases of aging, such as cancer, CVD, and type 2 diabetes.**\n\n**Cell senescence can be triggered by many stimuli (fig.14):**\nEleonora Deinite 54 08.05.2023 POLI fig.14 persistent DNA damage oncogene activation or inactivation epigenetic alterations mitochondrial dysfunction → reactive oxygen species, both radical and non-radical oxidized phospholipids excessive amount of oxidized cholesterol amyloid-β sodium urate as in gout excessive cholesterol crystals exposure to DAMPs that are released by stressed cells These factors stimulate autophagy and the activation of the proteasome, which eliminate the damaged proteins. When these compounds accumulate, they overwhelm our immune system and increase the inflammation. This typically occurs in aging. 6.NLRP3 inflammasome activation 7.oxidative stress caused by dysfunctional mitochondria 8.immune cell dysregulation Gene-expression studies show that CD4+ lymphocytes (T helper cells) in given tissues from older individuals have higher intrinsic activation of the NF-κB pathways than those from younger individuals. Since you have inflammation, the immunological sector is involved as well. 9.chronic infections Subclinical and clinically evident chronic infections can continuously stimulate immune function and result in changes in levels of inflammatory markers that are indistinguishable from those of the inflammaging signature. ! So, inflammation has an important role in aging and non-communicable disease, so it must be prevented through proper nutrition, physical activity and control of the body weight to avoid the accumulation of endocrine adipocytes. All these mechanisms work together and amplify the overall picture of an early and bad aging.

Atherosclerosis is a progressive and chronic degenerative disease, affecting the intima of large and medium-sized arteries of elastic and muscle-elastic type. The starting point is a chronic inflammatory response. The disease involves: - intima thickening - loss of wall elasticity - presence of typical lesion called “atheroma” or “atherosclerotic plaque” ATHEROMA:CHARACTERISTICS AND DEVELOPMENT accumulation of lipids in sub-endothelial area (in the intima), carried by LDL • presence of fibroinflammatory reaction: ocontinuous cell migration (monocytes mainly); osclerosis (abundant collagen fibers with numerous intermolecular connections loss of elasticity). Smooth muscle cells in the intima migrate to intima and secrete collagen fibers. The morphology is of a patchy white-yellow lesion growing on the lumen of the artery, involving only a portion of the arterial wall. The principal arteries that are affected by this progressive degenerative disease are: - coronary arteries - arteries of the cerebral circulation - internal carotid arteries - abdominal and thoracic aorta - iliac arteries - femoral arteries - popliteal arteries This disease is totally absent in capillaries, veins, and lymphatic circulation. It usually happens at the level of curvatures and bifurcations: this is due to higher pressure and turbulence, that can favor the formation of these lesions. ATHEROSCLEROSIS IS MULTIFACTORIAL Multiple risk factors can increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. Risk factors can divide into modifiable and non-modifiable. ➢Modifiable risk factors: 1.Hyperlipidemia: due to hypertriglyceridemia but mostly hypercholesterolemia (per se sufficient to develop atherosclerosis). An increased amount of cholesterol concentration will cause the increase of LDL, lipoproteins which carry lipids from the liver to the body (lipids can’t be present in the blood alone). This cholesterol can be defined as “bad cholesterol”, due to its ability to increase the risk of forming atherosclerosis. HDL, on the other hand, collects all the cholesterol not used or derived from the turnover of membrane cells. The excessive cholesterol is carried from peripheral tissues to the liver. The balance between these lipoproteins is very important: a higher LDL/HDL ratio is associated with atherosclerosis. To avoid the risk it is possible to decrease LDL and raise HDL through diet, exercise (increases HDL) and drugs (that either lower LDL or total cholesterol or raise HDL). Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 23 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 To sum up, hypercholesterolemia causes are: - increased LDL cholesterol levels - decreased HDL cholesterol levels - increased levels of abnormal lipoprotein (altered form of LDL: apo B-100 linked to apo A) - hypercholesterolemia ROS production EC dysfunction 2.Hypertension (especially systolic): in arterial circulation the pressure is high, but in case of hypertension the high pressure can cause a disfunction of endothelium (especially in curvatures and bifurcations). The hypertension can cause damage to artery walls. 3.Diabetes mellitus: characterized by hyperglycemia (explained in detail in Gamba’s “Diabetes mellitus” lesson). Glucagon mobilizes lipids in adipose tissue in order to obtain energy causing hypercholesterolemia. Glucose that is free in the circulation can also bind to proteins of the inflamed arterial wall increasing the inflammatory response. 4.Cigarette smoking: hydrocarbon radicals and nicotine are produced through smoking, and both can stimulate growth factors and inflammatory process at the level of arterial walls. ➢Constitutional risk factors (non-modifiable): 1.Genetic factors: hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia can be familial diseases with a genetic basis. Familial hypercholesterolemia, for example, is an autosomal dominant due to absence or defect of the hepatic receptor for LDL. 2.Age: can start at the age of 20-50 staying asymptomatic. It can become symptomatic starting at the age of 40-60. 3.Gender: more frequent in men than premenopausal women (protected by estrogens), as well as the risk of myocardial infarction. ➢Additional risk factors (non-modifiable): 1.Hyperhomocysteinemia (methionine metabolite): high levels of homocysteine (if present in urine = homocystinuria). Due to rare inborn errors of metabolism (autosomal recessive disease). The effects are: a.endothelial lesion (inducing ROS production) b.inhibition of anticoagulative, antithrombotic, and vasodilator systems induced by nitric oxide c.contribution of inflammatory response 2.Inflammation: C reactive protein (CRP) produced during inflammation --> contribute to inflammatory state by increasing production of inflammatory mediators. It is a strong marker for myocardial infarction and stroke. 3.Lack of exercise, obesity, dietary, stressful life style (like alcohol abuse) 4.Viral infections (e.g. Chlamydia pneumoniae and cytomegalovirus) These factors are not fundamental but can increase the risk. Q.: I didn’t understand the role of the C reactive protein. A.: The C reactive protein is one of the APP. During the inflammatory response there are ways to recognize this state, like increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SED: velocity of sedimentation in erythrocytes) due to increased APP, including CRP. An increased level of CRP leads to higher risk of atherosclerosis. The start of atherosclerosis is always due to inflammation, caused by one or more of the risk factors mentioned above. CRP can contribute to inflammation by producing other inflammatory mediators. Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 24 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 “RESPONSE TO INJURY” HYPOTHESIS Atherosclerosis can be a response to injury. 1.The risk factors are responsible of a disfunction of the endothelium (not properly a lesion but an inflammation). The endothelium is impermeable, so the cells can’t adhere. But when the endothelium starts to lose its anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic ability the cells can attach to the endothelium. 2.Due to the disfunction there is an increase in permeability, so that the LDL rich in cholesterol starts to cross in the endothelium and to accumulate in the intima. Following the accumulation in the intima there is an accumulation of monocytes, that start to differentiate and phagocyte the LDL with the aim to remove all of it. This response to injury is protective because it can remove the LDL. ATHEROSCLEROSIS PATHOGENESIS 1.Chronic endothelial injury and dysfuction: increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion 2.Accumulation of lipoproteins in the intima: in the vessel wall; mainly LDL and oxidized LDL. Here the lipids and apoproteins get oxidized, and particularly oxidized LDL is the main atherogenic element, responsible for the lesion. 3.Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium: migration into the intima, differentiation into macrophages “foam cells” (due to lipid accumulation within them they have these bubbles appearing within them) 4.Platelet adhesion 5.Inflammatory factor release: from all the cells involved 6.Smooth muscle cell migration to sub endothelium: proliferation, ECM production, especially collagen (SMC start to act as fibroblasts: modify their morphology and start to look and act like fibroblasts), and T cell recruitment 7.Atherosclerotic plaqueformation: composed by a central necrotic (lipid) chore, full of extracellular and intracellular lipids. Given that lipids are cytotoxic the cells start to die and release them outside. Cells, lipids form the necrotic chore. Under the endothelium there is fibrotic tissue (collagen fibers) called fibrotic cap, responsible for the rigidity of the arterial wall. The main causes of endothelium dysfunction, as already mentioned, are: - Hemodynamic disturbances: turbulence (especially in curvatures) - Hypercholesterolemia (sufficient to cause endothelial disfunction). Definable as >200 mg/dl of cholesterol. The professor repeats the causes seen in the modifiable risks. Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino fig.1 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 In fig. 2 it is possile to see the composiiton of LDL. fig.2 ROLE OF OXLDLS LDLs become very dangerous when they are oxidized because they have a high atherogenic activity. OxLDLs have different actions: Macrophages can uptake the oxLDL through the scavenger receptor, especially CD36, and LDL itself can induce the expression/synthesis of it Increase the synthesis and release of cytokines and GF ((e.g. TGFβ1, MCP-1) by vascular cells (macrophages, T cells, platelets ecc). chemotactic for circulating monocytes and contribute to their differentiation increase the adhesion of monocytes by induction of adhesion molecules by ECs inhibit the mobility of macrophages residing in the intima cytotoxic for vascular cells induce the proliferation of SMCs activate T lymphocytes and platelets stimulateMMP expression in macrophages and reduce TIMP expression SEQUENCE OF CELLULAR INTERACTION IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS The crosstalk of the cells involved in atherosclerosis is very important. Each cell stimulates the other cells to release a huge number of inflammatory mediators, cytokines, GF ecc.. The cells stimulate in particular the macrophages and the smooth muscle cells. 1.Chronic hyperlipidemia: endothelium disfunction followed by increased permeability allows LDLs to accumulate within the intima, where they may aggregate or become oxidized by free radicals produced by inflammatory cells. 2.Migration of macrophages and uptake of oxLDL through scavenger receptors (e.g. CD36) inducing the formation of “foam cells”. Their death will release the oxLDL. 3.SMCscan similarly transform into “foam cells” and produce ECM oxLDs stimulate the release of adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, etc monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation SMC proliferation and migration matrix synthesis Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 26 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 fig.2 In the fig. … it is possible to see an atherosclerotic plaque in a human carotid artery. The squared region contains the atheroma: - brown staining of the CD36 of the macrophages - green staining of the CD68 of macrophages - green fluorescent staining of Apo-B100 - red staining of lipids fig. 3 Any risk factor can cause endothelial dysfunction by increasing the permeability of endothelium. The increased permeability allows LDL to cross the endothelium, passing from the blood into the intima. Our body tries to avoid the change of location of LDL through a defense mechanism that consists in monocytes that start to migrate into the intima, here they differentiate into macrophages with the purpose of phagocytosing LDL. Sometimes, in the beginning, macrophages are able to remove all the LDL, so this condition can be reversible, but this is not always possible, that’s why is important to eliminate the risk factors responsible for endothelial dysfunction to avoid completely the passage of LDL from the blood to the intima. If the risk factor is present for months or years, the damage is not reversible, and the endothelial dysfunction causes the accumulation of LDL in the intima and the consequent formation of atheroma. PATHOGENESIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROMA In the pathogenesis of atheroma two phases can be distinguished: • Pre-Clinical Phase→ In this phase atheroma is developing without symptoms (slowly and progressively, can take years). Usually young age. Clinical Phase→ In this phase the clinical manifestations arise. Usually middle age to elderly. Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 27 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 fig. 4 PRE-CLINICALPHASE 1.Fatty Streak (at this point the lesion can be reversible) o Fatty streak is a yellow and flat lesion slightly protruding in the lumen. o Lipids start to accumulate in the intima without disturbing the circulation (because it does not accumulate in the lumen of the artery, but in the intima). o Is composed mainly by LDL and macrophages which start to phagocytose the LDL to remove it. At the beginning, some yellow, small spots can be observed, later these spots can form one large, elongated fatty streak. o Appear early in age: in the 20s or in infants, always before 40s. o The progression process from fatty streaks to fibrofatty plaque takes months, or even years, since it’s a chronic inflammation. o Can regress if the dysfunction of the endothelium stops (by removing the risk factors) and all the LDL is removed by macrophages. Otherwise, if the risk factors persist the atheroma forms. fig. 5 fig. 7 fig.8 Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 28 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 Fig. 7 and fig. 8 are examples of initial atheroma, the beginning of the formation of the fatty streak. In the images, the foam cells and macrophages full of lipids can be observed. 2.Fibrofatty Plaque (in addition to lipids the fibrotic tissue starts to form) o Is a white/white-yellow intimal thickening which tends to protrude into the lumen of the artery due to the increased accumulation of cells and lipids (it partially occupies the lumen of the artery). The clinical manifestations are not present yet but the compromission of the circulation starts. The migration in the intima of LDL, macrophages and T-o lymphocytes occurs. fig. 9 o Thanks to inflammatory mediators released by vascular cells and by the oxidized LDL, smooth muscle cells are stimulated and start to migrate and to proliferate, modifying their morphology and functions: they transform into myofibroblasts responsible for the production of the extracellular matrix (mainly collagen) causing the thickening of the cell wall (they are not fibroblasts, but they are muscle cells acting like fibroblasts). Therefore, the formation of the fibrotic tissue occurs slowly, causing rigidity (loss of elasticity). 3.Advanced/Vulnerable Plaque o Atheroma causes a critical reduction of the lumen of the artery due to months/years of accumulation of lipids. As the plaque enlarges and protrudes into the lumen causes critical stenosis. o The area under the epithelium is deformed due to the formation of the fibrotic tissue. This fibrotic atheroma is called “fibrotic cap” and is made mainly by collagen. The presence of the fibrotic cap is responsible for the rigidity of the wall and can also protect the atheromic cells allowing the plaque to be stronger. o There is the formation of new blood vessels (neovascularization) inside the plaque, a continuous recruitment of blood cells, proliferation of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix. o The accumulation of oxidized LDL takes place mainly in macrophages, but also in smooth muscle cells. The presence of these lipids in the cytoplasm is toxic, as a consequence the cells start to die, release outside the oxidized LDL phagocytosed before. The center of the atheroma is formed: is composed of debris (necrotic cells), foam cells and extracellular lipids and is called the “necrotic core” or “lipid core”. Other areas where advanced plaque can be observed: • An area with calcium deposition (area of calcification) that can contribute to the rigidity of the wall; • An area with cholesterol crystals accumulation Both are responsible for loss of elasticity: The artery cannot anymore change its diameter (vasoconstriction/vasodilation) because the wall is rigid. Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 29 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 fig.10 Fig.10: The central part of the plaque is called necrotic core and is composed of necrotic cells, foam cells, cholesterol crystals, calcification, and intra/extracellular lipids. The fibrotic cap is composed of fibrotic tissue mainly composed of collagen, new vessels and other elements all contributing to the rigidity of the wall. There are two types of advanced plaque: 1.Stable Plaque→ The necrotic core is small in size. There is less inflammation and the fibrous cap is very thick and strong (can protect the atheromic cells). Stenosis of the vessel with reduction of the lumen (kind of vasoconstriction) is present, thus the pressure is higher and the blood has difficulty in flowing through. Normally, the increased pressure can easily break the plaque that protrudes in the lumen, however, as long as the fibrous cap is thick and strong, it prevents the break of the plaque. 2.Unstable (Vulnerable) Plaque→ Very big fig. 11 necrotic core and strong inflammatory state. The fibrous cap is thin, atheroma is not strong and so the pressure of the blood can easily provoke the rupture of the plaque. The integrity of the fibrous cap depends on the production and degradation of the matrix components: if there is a high production of MMPs and a decreased production of TIMPs, the matrix will be degraded and the fibrous cap becomes thin and breaks easily. CLINICALPHASE Usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly people. Clinical phase is characterized by progressive growth of the plaque (the plaque grows very slowly). It is impossible for the plaque to grow enough to completely occlude the tubule, there are clinical manifestations caused by critical steatosis before (e.g. hypoxia of the myocardium, which is called “angina pectoris”, caused by reduction of oxygen). When the plaque breaks the formation of a thrombus can immediately take place. If it occurs on the top of a plaque that already is protruding and partially occluding the lumen of the artery, the risk of the total occlusion of the artery (infarction) is very high. Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 30 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 Plaque rupture occurs most frequently in the shoulder region (point between the normal endothelium and the plaque itself), where the cap is very thin and has the highest infiltration of foam cells (macrophages). With the rupture of the endothelium, the pro-thrombotic factors present on exposed SMCs (for example thromboplastin aka tissue factor) can come in contact with the extrinsic coagulation factors. The contact of the coagulation factor with the plaque itself can immediately stimulate the coagulation cascade (the recruitment and the activation of the platelets, an extrinsic coagulation cascade). This fig. 12 process results in the formation of an abnormal clot aka thrombus immediately on the top of the plaque (abnormal because no hemorrhage is present, but the process is the same). After the exposition of the sub-endothelial basement the blood has higher thrombogenic properties that can provoke the aggregation of platelets, fibrin activation and formation of an abnormal clot called thrombus. The plaque already partially occludes the lumen, grow slowly hampering the circulation (very rarely it totally occludes the artery). It causes a critical stenosis with partial occlusion and ischemia. The true severe risk is the rupture: the thrombus (usually) completely occludes the lumen, causing infarction and stroke. COMPLICATIONS OF ATHEROMATOUS PLAQUE 1.Calcification→ Deposition of calcium salts that contribute to the stiffness of the artery wall 2.Hemorrhage→ Rupture of the fibrous cap or of the thin-walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization (due to high blood pressure) cause intraplaque hemorrhage and consequently plaque expansion. 3.Plaque ulceration, erosion, or rupture→ Exposure of substances with aggregating and highly thrombogenic properties that result in thrombus formation which may partially or completely occlude the vessel lumen 4.Thrombosis→ Rupture of the plaque is the most important trigger: it immediately stimulates the release of tissue factors that cause the deposition of thrombogenic constituents which induce the activation of platelets and so the formation of a thrombus. 5.Embolism→ a) dissolution of the thrombus in fragments → emboli → complete occlusion of vessels with a smaller diameter. b) following rupture, necrotic debris and/or so-called cholesterol crystals (that can’t mix with blood) emboli may be released into the bloodstream → micro emboli. 6.Aneurysm→ Very dangerous complication that can occur when there is an advanced plaque (quite frequent in the aorta due to the very high pressure). In this case, instead of growing inside the lumen, the plaque pushes in the opposite direction. The plaque is then responsible for the atrophy of the media layer that loses its elasticity and becomes weak due to the progressive thinning. An aneurysm is an enlargement of the artery. The walls become bulged causing the formation of turbulence which can contribute to an inflammatory state. The artery has a high risk to break causing a very severe hemorrhage that can also cause the death of the patient for hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock. Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 31 03.04.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.02 fig.13 a) Stenosis of the lumen b) Thrombus formation and embolism c) Intraplaque hemorrhage d) Aneurysm formation From a clinical point of view, the complications depend on the size of the plaque. When the atheroma occludes the artery partially, some pathological conditions caused by hypoxia can occur. - partial occlusion occurs in the carotid arteries → risk is to develop dementia due to progressive cerebral ischemia; - hypoxia in the myocardium results in angina pectoris that is the step before the myocardial infarction; - presence of the plaques in the lower limbs can cause ischemia, so the necrosis of muscles and tissues, but no infarction thanks to collateral arteries, anyway necrosis is quite painful and the patients with the femoral artery affected start to limp because of the pain (claudication walk). - In case of the occlusion of the renal artery, there can be renal failures. fig.14 fig.15 Alessandra Giorgi, Beatriz Vitorino 32", "input": "", "output": "**what is atherosclerosis?Atherosclerosis is the most common type of arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).It is a chronic inflammatory condition that underlies coronary heart disease, cerebral vascular disease and peripheral vascular disease.ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) causes more morbidity and mortality than any other disease.

However there are certain Mendelian disorders that are strongly associated (e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia)\n\n**what are the modifiable risk factors for atherosclerosis?**\nSmoking: doubles the rate of ischemic heart disease. Hypercholesterolemia: lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B100 (LDL, VLDL,Lp(a)). High risk with high Lpa independent from LDL. Protective role of HDL. Hypercholesterolemia alone is sufficient to initiate the lesion. Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), PCSK9 inhibitors, Ezetimibe Hyperhomocysteinemia: promotes atherosclerosis through increased oxidant stress, impaired endothelial function, andinduction of thrombosis. Most commonly caused by B-vitamin deficiencies, especially folic acid. Homocysteinuria (rare autosomal disease) causes premature vascular disease.

Endothelial dysfunction caused by chronic injury: hypertension, smoking, toxins, infections, homocysteine, hemodynamicdisturbances (turbulent flow) and hypercholesterolemia. ApoB100 particles enter endothelial cells by interacting with LDLr. Inside the dysfunctional ECs subjected to chronic injury, LDL particles can undergo oxidative modification due to ROS. 2. Expression of Adhesion Molecules: Oxidized LDL stimulates endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). 3. Monocyte Adhesion and Infiltration: adhesion and infiltration of circulating monocytes into the arterial wall. 4. Inflammation: activation of the inflammasome → IL1 release → recruitment of macrophages and T lymphocytes → moreinflammation. 5. Macrophages engulf LDLox particles → foam cells → fatty streak 6. SMCs proliferate in the intima and also ingest LDL. In response to the fat ingestion, these cells secrete inflammatory cytokines 7.

Fatty streak: In the beginning, there’s a flat or slightly protruding yellow lesion composed of foam cells. Begin as multiple small yellow spots that eventually fuse (1 cm or longer). Not all become mature lesions. They can appear in aortas of children; coronary and carotid fatty streaks begin to form in adolescence. They are reversible. 2. Initial atheroma: foam cells, a few T cells, migration of SMCs into the intima. 3. Fibrous cap formation: As the lesion becomes a mature atheroma with SMCs that proliferate in the intima and form a fibrous(collagenous) cap, there’s initially an expansion of the media towards the outside of the vessel, so the lumen does not shrink. 4. Advanced plaque: Eventually the atheroma grows until the expansion of the outer wall is no longer allowed, so it starts to expand towards the lumen → stenosis.Morphology: Fibrous cap: SMCs surrounded by collagen, elastic fibers and proteoglycans (ECM), more thick connective tissue, few lymphocytesNeovascularizationContinuous recruitment and proliferation of monocytes/macrophages, accumulation of intra- and extracellular lipidsContinuous recruitment of SMCs, proliferation and deposition of ECMDeath of foam cells (apoptosis or necrosis) →Necrotic core:cellular debris, foam cells, lipid accumulation, fibrin and other plasma proteins,Cholesterol crystalsCalcification\n\n**describe the complications of an advanced atherosclerotic plaque**\nCalcification: deposition of calcium salts in the advancedatheroma, both focal (in the core) and diffuse→ arterial stiffness Hemorrhage: rupture of the overlying fibrous cap, or the thin- walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization (high blood pressure) → intraplaque hemorrhage → plaque expantion Plaque ulceration, erosion, or rupture: exposure of substances with aggregating and highly thrombogenic properties → thrombus formation which may partially or completely occlude the vessel lumen; Thrombosis: platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition→ thrombus which may occlude the vessel lumen partially → stenosis (flow reduction) → chronic tissue ischemia → atrophy. completely → ischemic necrosis (infarction) of the tissue → myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral infarction (stroke), gangrene of intestine or legs, etc Embolism:a) dissolution of the thrombus → emboli → complete occlusion of vessels with a smaller diameter.b) following rupture, necrotic debris and/or so-called cholesterol crystals emboli may be released into the bloodstream→microemboli Aneurysms: chronic ischemia and pressure→ atrophy of the media, loss of elastic tissue → weakening of the vascular wall → rupture→ hemorrhage\n\n**Frequent atheromas in the coronary arteries (especially in the SX coronary) → progressive stenosis of the lumen and painful → angina pectoris (reduced blood supply → myocardial ischemia (retrosternal pain).

Pogressive stenosis of the main leg arteries: tissue hypoxia with a painful symptomatology, especially after muscular effort but also at rest: claudication intermittens. Occlusion of a large arterial vessel of legs does not lead to infarction (collateral circulation) but necrosis and gangrene may occur. Artery occlusion also caused by an embolus deriving from the fragmentationof a thrombus localized on an atherosclerotic lesion. Sclerotic vessel is rigid and does not withstand blood pressure: formation of aneurysms. Aneurysm rupture → death due to hemorrhage.\n\n**depending on the intrinsic properties of the atheroma, what are its possible fates?Atherosclerotic plaques are susceptible to clinically importantpathologic changes that vary mainly depending on the thickness (stability) and composition of the fibrous cap (intrinsic properties), as well as extrinsic properties (blood pressure, platelet reactivity, etc).**\nClinical stenosis happens when the plaque is large enough that 75% of the lumen is occluded, this can result in tissue ischemia. Plaques with a thick fibrous cap can undergo erosion/ulceration, exposing thrombogenic factors that induce thrombosis. In the most severe of cases this results in sudden cardiac death, however it is more likely that this results in a rapid expansion of the plaque and more prominent calcification (which in turn may lead to critical stenosis) Vulnerable plaques are plaques with thin fibrous caps and active inflammatory cells over a necrotic core. The loss (necrosis) of SMCs and the overexpression of MMPs as well as underexpression of TIMP lead to collagen degradation and reduced collagensynthesis which results in a thiner, less stable cap. This is highly prome to plaque rupture which induce thrombosis that is often completely occlusive → sudden cardiac death.\n\n**what is atherosclerosis?**\nAtherosclerosis is the most common type of arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). It is a chronic inflammatory condition that underlies coronary heart disease, cerebral vascular disease and peripheral vascular disease.

It’s a hypoperfusion of the tissue, because the tissues that are not able to get nutrients and oxygen from the vessels undergo necrosis (ischemic necrosis in this case). What is the difference between ischemia and hypoxia? Hypoxia is the lack of oxygen, so just one part of ischemia. Ischemia is the effect of a general lack of oxygen and nutrients. For example, ischemia is a myocardial infarction or other types of conditions in which there is hypoxia and a decrease in the supply of nutrients, like the insufficiency in peripheral vessels or hypovolemic shock. So, ischemia can induce necrosis, but reperfusion can amplify the damage that is triggered, so it’s a condition that induces injury and disorder in the tissue. Ischemia can be due to an obstruction of the vessel, which occurs during myocardial infraction, during insufficiency of peripheral vessels, during hypovolemic shock. During these diseases the first thing the doctor needs to do is to open again the vessels in order to induce a reperfusion, restore the blood flow to the tissue that is now in necrosis. So, reperfusion is the restore of the blood flow. So, soon after ischemia occurs there is another step: the restoration of the flow. For example, in a heart attack the first clinical approach is the restoration of the flow to supply oxygen to the patient. The flow restoration, essential to prevent further irreversible damage, on the other hand, induces in a portion of the tissue a very high injury and necrosis. So, it increases the damage in one portion of the tissue. Therefore, ischemia induces damage (necrosis) so we try to give oxygen, but during the reflow of the blood there is an increase of the damage that can decrease over time. But the first reaction is the presence of a high quantity of necrotic cells. When this type become severe, we can say this particular severe ischemia has systemic inflammation response or multiple organ disfunction, when the inflammation become systemic. Ischemia reperfusion can occur during thrombolytic therapies, organ transplantation, in coronary angioplasty, cross-clamping aorta (closure of the aorta and then the new opening) or cardiopulmonary bypass. It can induce a very severe disease: systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which in turn can induce the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This occurs because during necrosis there is always inflammation. Also depending on the amount, the area and the volume of tissue that undergoes necrosis, we can have a severe inflammation and the amplification of this inflammation to systemic organs. (to deepen the topics) CELL CHANGES DURING ISCHEMIA They correspond to the changes that we see during necrosis: Altered permeability of the membrane which leads to altered membrane potential. Alteration of the pumps and of ion distribution, in particular increase of intake of intracellular Ca2+ which is important in the induction of cell damage. This occurs in necrosis since Ca2+ activates proteases and kinases (and it can form insoluble crystals); Cellular swelling→ water comes inside the cell to equilibrate the oncopressure and counteract the accumulation of metabolites intracellularly. Cytoskeletal actin disorganization and disorganization of the membranes of organelles. In particular, the disorganization of organelles involves mitochondria, the most involved in ischemia. Therefore, there is a decrease in energy of the cell and a decrease of ATP. Decreased ATP: because there is damage of all the membranes of all the organelles present in the cell, Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 1 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 including mitochondria. Increased (hypoxanthine) Cell acidosis: due to the disregulation of intracellular ions. High quantity of positive ions such as calcium. There is a low PH (acidosis). ISCHEMIA EFFECTS ON CELLS Decreased (ATP): it causes the accumulation of hypoxanthine. Intracellular accumulation of hypoxanthine and low oxygen concentration induce production of ROS and lack of production of ATP. Induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)production with further increase during reperfusion. The process just described occurs in necrotic cells, in the ischemic tissue. Xanthine oxidase needs oxygen but during these two oxidations steps the enzyme produces, in addition to uric acid, the superoxide anion. This is one of the reactive oxygen species and it is also a free radical (the dot of the chemical formula represents the presence of the radical). A radical is an unstable molecule because there is an unpaired electron in the most external orbital. Therefore, due to the low oxygen concentration in the necrotic tissue, there is high concentration of the superoxide anion. ISCHEMIA EFFECTS ON THE VASCULATURE Acute inflammation is the first response (so we have neutrophils, not macrophages) and it leads to an increased expression of inflammatory genes (interleukins, prostaglandins) that are associated with the alteration of the permeability of the vessels (adhesion molecules, cytokines, prostaglandins, and other inflammatory mediators). There is also the expression of bioactive agents like thromboxane A2 and endothelin that are important in the relaxation or the constriction of the vessels. The inflammatory cells involved are neutrophils. In the meantime, there is a repression of the so-called protective molecules: prostacyclin and nitric oxide, in particular the latter is a vasodilator. In this case, during ischemia if there is alteration in the regulation of nitric oxide production, there is an increase on the restriction of vessels. Nitric oxide is produced by (iNOS) nitric oxide synthetize, which is an important constitutive enzyme that normally induces the tone of the vessel, the vasodilation. Q: Ischemia should increase the vascular permeability, right? A: It is associated with the increase of inflammation that increases the vascular permeability. MECHANISM OF DAMAGE We talked about mitochondrial damage, therefore if there is a mitochondrial damage there is an alteration on the respiration, so intake of oxygen for the respiration is associated with production of energy. So, if there is hypoxia, there is also a lack on the production of ATP: there is no sufficient energy to produce ATP, ATP is produced by the linkage between AMP to a phosphate but this binding is not possible. So if there is not enough oxygen, we do not have enough energy. We can see this during ischemia: accumulation of ATP, but also accumulation of precursors of ATP: AMP, adenosine and inosine to become hypoxanthine. So, damage in mitochondria induces damage in oxidative phosphorylation and therefore there is a decrease in ATP and an increase in precursors of ATP, and so accumulation of hypoxanthine. Accumulation of hypoxanthine is due to deficit of energy and oxygen for the oxidative phosphorylation (phosphorylation and oxidation are uncoupled). Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 2 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 In the normal pressure of oxygen there is the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase enzyme that is able to reduce the cofactors, AMP, ADP to produce ATP. In hypoxic condition xanthine hydrogenase is changed in another isoform, xanthine oxidase, that can be activated during low pressure of oxygen, which means that this enzyme can work even in low quantity of oxygen in the cell. This enzyme’s activity is not a reduction toward the formation of ATP but an oxidation. So it uses hypoxanthine as substrate and the low content of oxygen present to change hypoxanthine into xanthin, and then change xanthine in uric acid. These two steps are very important because they use a molecule of oxygen to produce an oxygen radical: superoxide anion, the first type of radical that comes from the oxidation of oxygen. So, we start seeing an increase of this oxygen radical, but we have in the cell other type of enzymes. They are protective enzymes (antioxidant enzymes) like SOD, that is superoxide dismutase, named like this because it “dismutes” the radical oxygen, superoxide anion in H2O2, that is not a radical but an oxygen species. Which is also reactive. Therefore, there is another antioxidant enzyme which is catalase CAT that changes the H2O2 into water. In cells there is presence of iron, and iron is utilized in Fenton reaction that produces starting from superoxide anion, another radical called hydroxyl radical which is very important because it is able to induce lipid peroxidation, the breakdown of membranes of lipids. In the meantime, there is inflammation: neutrophils are activated in a very soft way because if there is an ischemia there is no flow, so only the neutrophils that are there during ischemia can be activated otherwise there are not enough neutrophils, there is only a small damage. Neutrophils that are in the tissue are activated through the oxidative burst, a burst (formation of high quantity) of ROS. This burst, in the case of the activation of neutrophils, is due two main important enzymes: NADPH oxidase is on the membrane of neutrophils, and it converts molecular oxygen into superoxide anion. Through the superoxide dismutase there is an increase of H2O2 which has a bactericidal effect, inducing damage of bacteria (one of the functions of neutrophils). Myeloperoxidase is present in the granules of neutrophils. This enzyme, in the presence of ROS and chloride, is able to produce another oxygen species: hypochlorous acid HOCl, another bactericidal molecule. So, this is the damage due to the high quantity of ROS. fig. 1 Q: We have never mentioned whether the superoxide anion can also form adducts, can it? Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 3 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 A: Yes, it can but not directly. The direct addition of superoxide anion is converted into hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are those that directly attack other molecules because they try to reach the stable form. So, the electron which is unpaired attacks other electrons that are in the double bond to reach stability. In doing this, the radical becomes stable, but the double bond becomes unstable. Now it is the double bond that has an unpaired electron. This unpaired electron continues jumping through double bonds. This is lipid peroxidation. During this process, all the electrons try to be stable and the only way to become stable is the break of the molecules into the final compounds, which are more stable (aldehydes, hydroxynonenal, hydroxyhexanal and so on). They are produced during peroxidation because they are very short and more stable. They come from the breakdown of free fatty acids. SOURCES OF HYDROXYL RADICAL Fig.2shows how the presence of iron is important for the formation of these radicals. The two important reactions are the Haber-Weiss Reaction, whose first step is associated with the Fenton reaction. The Fenton reaction needs iron in the oxidized form (ferrous iron) is formed from ferric iron. The ferrous iron in the presence of H2O2, becomes again ferric iron, producing hydroxyl radical. Superoxide anion reacts with H2O2 forming oxygen and hydroxyl radical. So, the Haber-Weiss Reaction is the association of these two first reactions from ferric to ferrous and then from ferrous to ferric. In the meantime, superoxide anion changes into oxygen and H2O2. Therefore, the final reaction, which is the addition of the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, produces oxygen and hydroxyl radical. fig. 2 Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 4 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 WHAT HAPPENS DURING REPERFUSION? fig. 3 The left of the image is during ischemia. In the case of the reflow, a high quantity of neutrophils arrive. These cells are responsible for the main damage that we see during reperfusion, there is an increase in the oxidative burst. Many leukocytes arrive in the blood and are activated in an acute way, which amplifies the formation of ROS and not only. There is a direct damage by lipid peroxidation, but leukocytes that are activated also increase the leukocyte-endothelial adherence, because there is an inflammation. So during reflow we increase oxygen, but this so high quantity of reperfusion is used by xanthin oxidase which is already induced to overproduce the uric acid All these leukocytes are present in an acute form of inflammation, and they form a block due to the high amount in that site. This type of process is the so-called no-reflow syndrome. We try to give blood and oxygen but, in the meantime, so many neutrophils arrive that they physically block the diameter, the lumen of the vessels. So, there is a mechanical obstruction. Activated leukocytes release ROS, proteases, and elastases, resulting in increased vascular permeability and increased edema in the surrounding tissue. They also activate endothelial cells to secrete prothrombotic molecules, so they induce thrombosis in the surrounding tissue of ischemia. Therefore, there is death of parenchymal cells. To sum up, the manifestations of the I/R injury are: Vascular injury and the “No Reflow” phenomenon. In the cardiac tissue there is an alteration of the contractility due to the necrosis and the inflammatory damage induced by leukocytes. So, there is an alteration in the contractility called myocardial stunning. Reperfusion Arrhythmias. I/R injury can also be present in other types of tissues: CNS, GI. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) Risk factors: hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, or diabetes LIVER TRANSPLANTATION Besides myocardial infarction another example is liver transplantation. During liver transplantation we have this ischemia-reperfusion damage. The liver that must be transplanted is transported from donor to patient Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 5 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 in anaerobic condition. It is transported in a box with buffers for example, in hypoxic conditions. Therefore, when the liver is inserted in the acceptor, surgeons close the vessels, they link the liver to the vessels and then they de-clamp (open) the vessels to induce the reflow of blood. During this reflow there is a very high increase in necrotic indices such as transaminases. So, there is an increase a thousand times higher than normal, due to the presence of this moment of necrosis and high damage. This reperfusion also induces the formation of a high amount of ROS in cells. It also induces damage to cell signaling. There is also an unbalance between NO (important in vasorelaxation) andET-1 (endothelin 1, important in vasoconstriction). Normally we have a higher amount of NO than ET-1 in vessels. In post-ischemic situations, during reperfusion, we have the reverse situation: there is an increase of ET-1 and a decrease of NO. Therefore, there is damage by this no-reflow process due to the high number of leukocytes that arrive in the tissue but there is also a vasoconstriction due to increase of ET-1. These two processes amplify the damage and block and the cells that are downstreamthis block continue to undergo necrosis and die. fig. 4 So, unbalance between NO and ET-1, oxidative stress, cytokine unbalance (due to activation of inflammation) and neutrophil infiltration activate and induce oxidative reactions and cellular oxidative stress. OXIDATIVE STRESS When oxidative stress occurs, cells counteract resulting oxidative effects and restore redox balance. They have redox- sensitive transcription factors that are activated due to low amounts of oxidative reactions,like Nrf2, Nf-KB, AP-1 that are able to defend the cells. Cell signals are modulated by redox changes in cells. When we have an increase in oxygen species, and depending on their reactivity, besides cell signaling modulation, we also have fibrosis (to repair the damage due to necrosis), inflammation and irreversible cell damage. This depends on the amount of reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation, that during ischemia and reperfusion is amplified, at low degrees is a normal (physiological) mechanism to change the lipid layers of the membranes. At high concentrations cells are not able to defend themselves because they don’t have enough antioxidant enzymes. Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 6 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 LIVER SURGERY/ LIVER TRANSPLANT/ SHOCK During hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury due to liver transplant, there is a release of systemic factors such as platelet activating factor (PAF), cytokineTNFalpha, nitric oxide and IL-1 that are able to activate expression of adhesion molecules. This is the pathogenesis of the activation of these molecules to induce thrombotic process. On the other hand, there is the activation of endothelial cells to secrete adhesion molecules. Neutrophils and endothelial cells activation induce high interaction of these two cells to amplify damage. fig. 5 This is a study of erythrocyte malonaldehyde content in 19 transplanted patients at basal time and at various post operation times. On the x axis there is the time of ischemia and reperfusion and on the y axis the erythrocyte malonaldehyde content (MDA), one of the products of lipid peroxidation triggered by ischemia. MDA, soon after the de-clamping of the vessels to the liver, increases a lot. The liver, during the days after transplantation, recovers thanks to the presence of hepatocytes that are stable cells, able to regenerate. However, during the transaminases, that must be about 26/30, were half a thousand. So, necrosis had occurred. fig. 6 first day, there is a very high quantity of MDA, so the formation of a high amount of radicals. Moreover, we evaluate the activity of transaminases ALT and the reperfusion time. During the reperfusion Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 7 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO PREVENT I-R INJURY We have some therapeutic strategies to prevent this damage. Ischemic Preconditioning: only in the clinical cases in which we know that ischemia reperfusion will occur, like in transplantation. Antioxidant Therapy: to patients that are under heart attack for example. Anti-complement Therapy: is activated by arrival of leukocytes. Anti-leukocyte Therapy: to avoid accumulation of leukocytes in necrotic tissue. The last three therapies are given to patients that are under heart attack. They try to decrease damage due to formation of ROS. ISCHEMIC PRECONDITION fig. 7 An exposure of tissues to brief periods of ischemia before real, high ischemia. This type of brief ischemia can activate cells to induce TF, antioxidant TF for example, to induce increase of endogenous antioxidant effects. There are two windows of ischemia. 10 minutes of preconditioning process (relax) and then 10 minutes of ischemia. Due to the presence of this very short period of ischemia, cells can activate two windows of protection. One is very fast, it occurs in 2-3 hours from reperfusion. The second window protection is 24-48 hours after reperfusion. Why are there two windows? Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 8 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 fig. 8 There is a release of adenosine, by the ischemic myocardium or the ischemic tissue in liver transplantation, which induces activation of G proteins. G proteins and the cascade of the signal activates phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) which in turn activate PKC, involved in changes of ion concentrations and increased production of ATP by mitochondria. The other important activity of this kinase is the activation of transcription factor NF-kB, due to proteolytic activity of the enzyme that induces degradation of IkB, the inhibitor of NF-kB. In a normal cell in which there is no increase in IkB, this inhibitor is linked to NF-kB. NF-kB, to be activated and become a transcription factor, requires degradation of IKb through ubiquitination. This way NF-kB is set free to become an active TF and to go to the nucleus to induce transcription of genes associated with antioxidant activity (superoxide dismutase, iNOS, HSP→ heat shock proteins). It transcripts for production of these antioxidant enzymes. During the first window of protection, we see this part of the signal; the second window of protection needs time to transcript and synthesize proteins and antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, we have a first window of protection very quickly, and then a second window of protection in the late phase. This type of preconditioning is a prevention, not a therapy. ANTIOXIDANT THERAPY Induction by the human recombinants of superoxide dismutase (experimental human recombinants in patients with hemorrhagic shock) Induction of Catalase; injection of anti-inflammatory molecules such as mannitol, very rapid; intake by diet of vitamin E, a very important antioxidant molecule; N-acetylcysteine, important to reduce and recover glutathione. We cannot give glutathione directly because it is very big, it does not enter the cells. The highest concentration of glutathione is in erythrocytes. We must give small molecules with the SH- group, so the thiol group (acetylcysteine) that maintains glutathione in the reduced form in erythrocytes. Allopurinol: inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. It is considered an antioxidant. Allopurinol has been inserted for 10 years in the buffer of transplanted tissues (in the box where they were placed with buffers, ions, nutrients for the transport). It can maintain stability by keeping ROS in a reduced form because it inhibits xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that produces superoxide anion. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzymes) are inhibitors to reduce Ca++ cell influx, or calcium channel antagonists. They avoid the increase of cell death. Rahma El Hilali, Sara Schiffini 9 21.03.2023 BIASI L.01 ANTI-COMPLEMENT THERAPY Other possible therapies can be associated with the active action of complement and leukocytes. They are biological therapies, attempts, not used now routinely to prevent ischemia reperfusion damage. C3 convertase inhibitor. Soluble complement receptor 1 decreases infarct size in experimental models (by 44% in a rat model of myocardial I-R). “Humanized” recombinant, antibody specific for human C5(h5G1.1-scFv) significantly attenuates complement activation, leukocyte activation, myocardial injury, blood loss, and cognitive dysfunction in humans undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. ANTI- LEUKOCYTES THERAPY They are used to avoid attachment and activation of leukocytes. In particular leukocytoapheresis: a particular machine induces an extracellular blood flow. There is a filter which blocks activated leukocytes in the extracorporeal flux so that they don’t enter the body. In the meantime, the patient produces leukocytes that are not activated. We prevent the formation of a block due to activated leukocytes, discarding the leukocytes that are active in adhesion. This is an important therapy attempt used not only in ischemia, but also in other types of diseases in which there is a high inflammation, like a chronic one. Depending on type of damage there can be monocyte apheresis, lymphocyte apheresis or mono-lymphocytes apheresis. WARNING: considering that I-R injury induces damage and necrosis of the tissue, we cannot avoid reperfusion when we are in front of a patient with a heart attack or an infarct and so on. It is really important to control reperfusion time after ischemia. So, after ischemia, inducing reperfusion as soon as possible is fundamental to limit damage and injury of the tissue (that has been in ischemia for a long time). It is the cornerstone of clinical practice.

Reperfusion is instead the phenomenon of restoring the flow. During ischemia, oxygen is lacking; for this reason the production of energy decreases; because of the decrease of ATP, cellular pumps cannot work. This induces a complete alteration of the membrane potential and alteration of the distribution of the ions (a lot of Ca++ can go in and activated proteases and other pathways). Moreover, the osmotic balance is lost and the cell start to swell. Cytoskeletal arrangement is also impaired. The metabolism of cells will switch to anaerobic glycolysis, with the production of lactate, thus acidosis occurs. Because of the decreased energy production ATP precursors such as hypoxanthine will accumulate. Hypoxanthine is usually metabolized by the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase, which in hypoxic condition turns to xanthine oxidase. Hypoxanthine is transformed by xanthine oxidase in xanthine and then in uric acid, with the production of superoxide anion. The activity of xanthine oxidase is low during ischemia, because it requires oxygen; therefore the biggest production of O- will actually be during reperfusion, when oxygen is available. Superoxide ion is a reactive oxygen species; ROS are indeed important for cellular communication in physiological conditions, but can be dangerous in ischemic condition because of the massive production, which cannot be counterbalanced by the normal anti-oxidant response (which includes CAT SOD glutathione peroxidase and reductase, vitamin A, C and E). Not balanced production of ROS results in cellular damage, fibrosis, induction of several inflammatory pathways (such as NFkB and AP-1) During ischemia, the vasculature will increase the expression of vasoconstrictor such as endothelin, and reduce the expression of vasodilators as NO. Moreover, pro inflammatory molecules will induce the adhesion and transmigration of inflammatory cells. In particular, degranulation of neutrophils will increase the amounts of ROS: NADPH oxidase produces superoxide ions, which is then metabolized by SOD to form hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is then metabolized either by a catalase (and transformed in water and oxygen), transformed in OH- in the presence of iron, or it is transformed in HOCL by myeloperoxidase. In any case, during reperfusion, the recruitment of neutrophils is even more increased: this phenomenon can result in a mechanical obstruction, which impedes the restoration of the flow. Another important role is played by the complement, especially by C5 and C3, which can remodel the vasculature and especially during reperfusion amplify the ischemic damage. Preconditioning is a technique aimed to prevent ischemia-reperfusion damage. It is especially important in transplants, in order to avoid a huge necrosis of the tissues due to the reperfusion (as in liver transplant). It consists of alternating moments of moderate ischemia (hypoxia and lack of nutrients), in order to induce a compensating response. In particular, adenosine has a huge role, creating two windows of defense. The first windows is 2-3- hours after the preconditioning: it is due to the activation of the PKC pathway The second window 24-48 h after the preconditioning is related to the transcription of the NFkB transcription factor. NFkB induces the expression of a number of molecules, such as lipoxins, resolvins iNOS (inducible nitrite oxidase syntase), catalase and superoxide dismutase ecc Even if the preconditioning technique can be quite useful and effective, in clinical settings it is always preferable to restore the flow as soon as possible in case of ischemia.\n\n**what are the therapeutic strategies to prevent I-R?**\nIschemic Preconditioning: only in the clinical cases in which we know that ischemia reperfusion will occur, like in transplantation.

BLOOD PRESSURE First of all, it is important to remember the mechanisms that regulate blood pressure (Fig.1). Blood pressure is defined as the product between the cardiac output and the peripheral resistance, hence these 2 factors regulate blood pressure. The cardiac output, in particular, is regulated by both cardiac factors (heart rate and myocardial contractility) and by blood volume (=stroke volume, this value can change according to the concentration in the circulation of sodium and mineralocorticoids or depending on the release of the atrial natriuretic peptide by the myocardium). The peripheral resistance can change as well, according to the ability of the vessels (arteries and veins) to change their lumen size; in this way, they are able to control the blood pressure through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Many factors can control the lumen of the vessels, such as: • humoral factors, which can be constrictors (like angiotensin II, catecholamines released by the adrenal gland, thromboxane and leukotrienes that are arachidonic acid derivatives, and endothelin released by endothelial cells) and dilators (prostaglandins, kinins, and NO) • local factors: they are involved in autoregulation of the lumen size, which can change according to hypoxia and pH • neural factors, divided into constrictors (α-adrenergic) and dilators (β-adrenergic). They can also regulate the heart rate and the contractility of the myocardium. The balance between all these factors is necessary to maintain the right lumen size of the vessels. Fig. 1 CARDIAC OUTPUT It's determined by the heart rate (contractility of the heart) and the stroke volume, which is the quantity of blood that flows in circulation in a specific unit of time. The cardiac output is strongly influenced by blood volume, which, in turn, is mainly regulated by renal sodium excretion or reabsorption that occurs through the renin-angiotensin system. The concentration of Na+ is very important for the maintenance of blood volume. In order to do this, many factors are released and they act adjusting the concentration of Na+: - Renin: a proteolytic enzyme released by the kidneys. Aldosterone: produced andreleased by the cortex of the adrenal gland. Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 54 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 Angiotensin II: derived from angiotensin I, which in turn derives from angiotensinogen produced by the liver. atrial natriuretic peptide:released by the myocardium. Kidneys filter 170 L of plasma containing 23 nanomoles of salt daily. 99.5% of filtered salt is reabsorbed, to maintain the total body concentration of Na+: - 98% of sodium is reabsorbed by active sodium transporters, mainly ENaC (epithelial Na+channels), regulated by aldosterone which favors the reabsorption of Na+ and water. 1.5% is reabsorbed by epithelial sodium channels regulated by the renin-angiotensin system. In the end, through these two activities, it’s possible to maintain constant the concentration of Na+ and blood pressure. In the presence of reduction of blood volume and pressure, there are macula densa cells, at the level of the kidney, that sense these reductions, leading to the release of effectors whose aim is to increase the blood volume and pressure. Which is the mechanism? Kidneys can influence the excretion/absorption of Na+ through the activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme produced by renal juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys and released by them in the presence of: - decreased blood pressure in afferent arterioles. elevated levels of circulating catecholamines. low Na+ levels in the distal convoluted renal tubules. So renin stimulates Na+ reabsorption. Thus, the aim of renin is to restore blood volume and blood pressure. This enzyme cleaves the angiotensinogen (synthesized in the liver) into angiotensin I, which, in turn, is converted into angiotensin II by the enzyme ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) released by the vascular epithelium. Angiotensin II acts by stimulating vasoconstriction to increase the blood pressure. In particular, it can: - stimulate the vasoconstriction, reducing the lumen sites of the vessel. stimulate aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland. increase tubular Na+ reabsorption (and so water) due to adrenal aldosterone. As an effect, this reabsorption leads to an increase in the blood volume and so of blood pressure. In particular, the blood pressure increases because by increasing the blood volume the cardiac output is increased. On one side, there are mechanisms that try to increase blood pressure but, on the other side, others decrease the pressure. It happens because the kidneys, at the same time, release not only vasoconstrictor elements but also vascular relaxing substances (prostaglandins and NO) to counterbalance the vasopressor effect of angiotensin. In addition, the myocardium releases myocardial natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) in response to the increased blood volume. These factors allow vasodilation and inhibit the Na+ reabsorption in the distal renal tubule, favoring the excretion of Na+ and diuresis. There could be the risk to increase too much blood pressure, so mechanisms that counteract the ones responsible for the increase in blood pressure must be present to obtain a balanced situation, in other words, a normal blood pressure. (Fig.2) makes a summary of the previous concepts. If we want to reduce the blood pressure, the heart releases ANP, which stimulates vasodilation (and so there is a decreased blood pressure) and inhibits the absorption of Na+, favoring its excretion. The result is a reduction in blood volume. If we want to increase blood pressure, the kidney releases renin, which converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which becomes angiotensin II by ACE. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of aldosterone, which favors the absorption of Na+ and water. The result is an increase in blood volume. Angiotensin II acts also on vessel cells enhancing vasoconstriction. It’s important to balance between increased pressure and decreased pressure, because all the previous mechanisms work together to maintain a constant blood volume and blood pressure. If the action of Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 55 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 angiotensin II exceeds, the patient will develop hypertension. In many situations the volume can increase: - excess dietary Na+. inadequate excretion (renal failure). hyperaldosteronism → excessive production of aldosterone that increases the absorption of Na+ and water. In other situations it can happen an increase in resistance: - increased sympathetic tone. increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Fig. 2 PERIPHERAL RESISTANCE It’s controlled by many factors (neural, humoral, and local) that affect the vascular smooth muscle cells altering their lumen size (so causing vasoconstriction or vasodilation), depending on the ability of the cells to contract. Arterioles: they are important for blood distribution to different organs and tissue, and for the regulation of arterial pressure: they are the principal points of physiologic resistance to blood flow. In the arteries, the blood flow is quite strong, but by reaching the arterioles it is reduced so as to supply the capillaries with a sufficiently low pressure. Veins: they can affect peripheral resistance through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. They play an important role in controlling capillary pressure; in this way, the exchange between capillary and interstitial fluid is possible. Veins can also control pressure in the blood flow, with effect on venous return and cardiac function. Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 56 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 (Fig.3) depicts the main characteristics of arterioles and veins. They have a very important role in controlling blood pressure. If the pressure must be increased the system applies vasoconstriction; if the pressure must be decreased, there is vasodilation. Fig. 3 HYPERTENSION It occurs when we have an increased cardiac output (due to increased blood volume, heart contractility/heart rate) or an increased total vascular resistance (due to changes in the activity of neural, humoral, and local effectors). In some situations, both these parameters increase. Hypertension is a pathological condition, characterized by altered mechanisms in the control of blood pressure, especially the regulation due to peripheral resistance. It’s a common disorder, affecting about 33% of adults in Italy: half of them are at high risk to develop cardiovascular events. It’s an important cardiovascular risk factor for atherosclerosis, which, in turn, is a risk factor for myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, renal failure, chronic obstructive arteriopathy, aortic aneurysm, vascular encephalopathies, etc. Hypertension is quite common in the white population: the prevalence is between 20-45%. It can also alter the arterial wall due to hyaline and fibroid degenerations: there is the accumulation of proteins and material in the E.C. space, leading to the thickening of the vessel’s wall, reducing the lumen of the vessel, and so there is an increase of the pressure. The normal value of blood pressure in adults is lower than130/85 mmHg (systolic pressure/diastolic pressure). The high normal value of blood pressure is 130-139/85-89 mmHg Depending on the value of blood pressure, it’s possible to classify the hypertension into five categories: - Borderline: values between 140/90-95 mmHg. Mild: values between 140-159/95-99 mmHg. Moderate: values between 160-179/100-109 mmHg. - - Severe: values between 180-209/110-119 mmHg. Very severe: values > 210/>120 mmHg. There are two types of hypertension: - Primitive/Essential: it’s not possible to recognize the etiology. It must be treated for all life because, in the absence of a cause, it’s not possible to act on it. Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 57 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 Secondary: is associated with specific causes; so acting on the primary cause, it’s possible to reduce hypertension. PRIMITIVE HYPERTENSION It is very common (90-95%) and usually occurs after the age of 40. It’s not possible to recognize a specific cause underlying the onset of hypertension, it’s a multifactorial disorder, meaning that many conditions can be involved in its development, both environmental and genetic (Fig. 4): Genetic factors:in some disorders, an excessive release of aldosterone favors an increased Na+ absorption in the kidney, and thus of water, so there is an increased blood volume, that lead to an increased cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction, and so an increased blood pressure. There could be defects concerning the production of angiotensinogen, or angiotensin receptor. There are patients in which the renin-angiotensin system is altered, with a consequent increase in Na+ reabsorption. There are also some genetic disorders regarding the factors that control peripheral resistance: some patients can release other quantities of vasoconstrictor factors (e.g. catecholamines) leading to an increase in peripheral resistance, and so an increase in blood pressure. As a consequence of different genetic influences, there could be modifications of the cardiac output, of peripheral resistance, or both. Environmental factors: some psychogenic components can contribute to modify the lumen of the vessel, and so they can contribute to increase the peripheral resistance. For example, subjects with excessive repression of a conflictual state, anxiety, depression, stress, but also other concomitant factors, like obesity, alcohol, smoking, physical inactivity, and heavy salt consumption are more prone to develop hypertension. Moreover, environmental factors, can act by leading to some alteration of smooth muscle cells’ structure, such as thickening of the wall (decreased lumen), hence there is an increased peripheral resistance, and so an increased blood pressure. Fig. 4 What is the mechanism that leads to the development of primitive hypertension? The first event is the reduction of renal Na+ excretion, even if the pressure is normal. The result is an increase in blood volume and in cardiac output. In addition, there can also present an increase in peripheral resistance. As a consequence, there is an increase in blood pressure (blood pressure = cardiac output x peripheral resistance). Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 58 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 To increase the blood volume, reaching the “threshold” of hypertension, is sufficient to increase the blood content of the arteries by 20-30 ml. The natural course of hypertension, in the beginning, is very long and asymptomatic, at least for primitive hypertension. In the case of secondary hypertension, there are clinical symptoms associated with the cause of hypertension, while in the case of primitive hypertension, in the beginning, there aren’t clinical symptoms, only an increase in blood pressure. It is possible to distinguish two forms of hypertension: There is a first phase in which hypertension is labile and inconstant (initial inconstant labile form). • This form is characterized by only an increase in cardiac output, whereas the peripheral resistance is normal. This phase is called “labile” because, over time, the peripheral resistance increases until stabilized hypertension is determined. Stable form.• High blood pressure can modify the morphology of vessels’ walls, by stimulating the enlargement of smooth muscle cells (= hypertrophy of cells); as a consequence, there is a reduction in the lumen of the vessels (Fig.5). Precapillary vessels of arterioles, in particular, increase their thickness due to hypertension, leading to a permanent reduction of the lumen. This contributes to increased blood pressure. Fig. 5 Primitive hypertension, other than be the most prevalent type, is also the most severe form, because it is one of the main risk of cardiovascular diseases. SECONDARY HYPERTENSION It comprehends 5-10% of all cases. It is possible to recognize a specific cause for it. It is associated with many diseases affecting the kidneys, adrenal glands or other endocrine organs. Treating on these diseases, we can reduce hypertension. Causes associated with the development of secondary hypertension: - Renal\n\n**Acute glomerulonephritis.**\n\n**Mono and bilateral pyelonephritis**\n\n**Nephrosclerosis**\n\n**Polycystic kidney disease.**\n\n**Renal artery stenosis.**\n\n**Renal vasculitis.**\n\n**Renin-producing tumors.**\nAll these conditions can cause a renal hypertension, and consequently, a systemic hypertension. Endocrine\n\n**Conn’s disease:**characterized by hyperaldosteronism, so an increased secretion of aldosterone. The latter contributes in the reabsorption of sodium, and so of water.\nConsequently, there will be an increase in the blood volume, and so in the blood pressure.\n\n**Pheochromocytoma:**the adrenal gland can increase the secretion of catecholamines. This increase occurs because of a tumor in the adrenal gland, that can stimulate the release of these hormones (catecholamines), which have a vasoconstrictor effect. Hence there is an increased peripheral resistance, and so an increase in blood pressure.\nLuca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 59 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5\n\n**Cushing disease (hypercortisolism):**increased production of corticosteroids, that contribute to an increased blood pressure.\nOther causes\n\n**Coarctation of the aorta:**the lumen of the aorta is reduced.\n\n**Intracranial hypertension**\n\n**Toxemia gravidarum:**characterized by renal changes with hypertension and edema all over the body.\n\n**Acute hypervolemia:**if the blood volume is increased, it will be increased also the cardiac output and so blood pressure.\nProfessor says that on the slide there is a more detailed list of causes, some of which she has just explained now. All these causes can be responsible for the development of secondary hypertension, but if these causes are treated, it is possible to reduce hypertension and obtain normal blood pressure. CONSEQUENCES OF HYPERTENSION At the beginning: - Primitive hypertension is asymptomatic. Secondary hypertension has clinical symptoms strictly associated with the disease underlying the development of hypertension. The symptoms are not those distinctive of hypertension itself. In the beginning, there are some compensatory mechanisms. For example, kidneys respond to hypertension by eliminating salts and water, hence reducing blood pressure. Kidneys try to maintain normal blood pressure favoring the release of sodium and water. Then occurs the initial inconstant labile form, where the cardiac output increases but the peripheral resistance remains constant. In the end, hypertension establishes, during which both cardiac output and peripheral resistance increase, and there is increased blood pressure. At this point, the clinical signs are the consequences of the effects of hypertension on different organs: - Vessels: hypertrophy due to hypertension and, over time, a deposition of material in the EC space. Heart: hypertrophy of left ventricle due to overwork (it must work more). The symptoms are those of left heart failure. nervous system: spasms, headache, vertigo, visual disturbances, necrosis of brain matter due to ischemia/microinfarction or to hemorrhage. Kidney: glomerular and tubular changes due to progressive nephron ischemia (chronic renal failure). - Aorta: severe atheroma, abdominal aortic aneurysms. hemorrhagic manifestations (not severe): nose, respiratory system, and female genital tract. Question from 2021-2022 Q: How environmental factors (in particular Na+ concentration) can induce peripheral resistance? A: Na+ is not related to the increase of the peripheral resistance. Na+ is included as an environmental factor if the diet is rich in sodium. The salts present in the diet can favor the absorption of water and, therefore, it contributes to the increase of blood volume. So it is connected to the cardiac output. Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 60 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 VASCULAR PATHOLOGY IN HYPERTENSION and fibroid degeneration. As it is possible to see here (Fig. 6), the arterial wall is thickened because of the accumulation of proteins, that reduce the lumen size, causing an increase in the peripheral resistance. Hypertension can be responsible for the degeneration of the vascular wall. In particular, hypertension is responsible for the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Hypertension can also cause the deposition of other proteins, leading to hyaline degeneration degenerative effect of hypertension: there is hyperplastic atherosclerosis. There is the formation of a concentric laminated thickened wall, with a reduction of the lumen, so a partial obliteration. This type of degeneration is quite frequent in kidneys. Fig. 6 Here (Fig. 7) there is another example of the Fig. 7 CONCLUSION ON HYPERTENSION Hypertension must be considered a severe pathological condition, especially primitive/essential hypertension, since it is not possible to identify the specific cause, and patients must be treated life-long. Primitive hypertension is based on the involvement of many genetic factors, hence it is difficult to recover from it. Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for myocardial infarction and stroke so it must be treated correctly. SHOCK Serious pathological event of acute circulatory insufficiency and it represents one of the primary causes of death. It is characterized by a reduction of cardiac output, reduction of peripheral resistance or circulating blood volume;the consequence is a reduction in the blood pressure (remember blood pressure = cardiac output x peripheral resistance), hence there is a reduction of tissue perfusion (hypoperfusion) because, due to hypotension, the blood is not able to reach all the tissues and organs. Thus, there is a dysfunction of the main vital organs and systems. The two main symptoms of the shock are marked hypotension and hypoperfusion. In the beginning, if this condition is not so serious, it can be reversible. But a prolonged shock leads to irreversible cellular damage, causing the failure of many organs and, therefore, the death of the patient. In any type of shock, there is circulatory collapse, which is due to severe hypotension and hypoperfusion, characterized by an abrupt lowering of the systolic pressure to levels that don’t allow an adequate supply of blood to the whole organism. If the cause responsible for the shock acts for a short time, it’s possible to compensate for this situation, returning to a normal circulatory function. On the other side, if the cause persists, peripheral hypoperfusion causes an irreversible alteration of metabolism and cellular damage in various tissues. Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 61 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 MECHANISMS OF SHOCK There are three mechanisms responsible for the onset of shock: - cardiac pump insufficiency (e.g. infarction, arrhythmia): if the heart doesn’t work properly, the cardiac output drops down and also the blood pressure. This mechanism is common in cardiogenic shock. uncompensated reduction of the volume (e.g. hemorrhage, burns, diarrhea, vomiting, etc.): if the blood volume decreases dramatically, the cardiac output decreases and also the blood pressure. This mechanism is common in hypovolemic shock. uncompensated increase in the capacity of the vascular bed (e.g. sepsis, hypersensitivity reaction, intoxication, etc.): it’s about the peripheral resistance. If there is a systemic dilation of the circulatory system, a reduction in peripheral resistance will occur due to dilation, and so the blood pressure goes down. This mechanism is common in distributive shock. In the first two mechanisms it is decreased the cardiac output, while in the third mechanism is the peripheral resistance to be decreased. Question from 2021-2022: Q: Can you explain how the decrease of peripheral resistance is associated with the shock? A: Peripheral resistance is very important in the control of the blood pressure because it’s able to change the lumen of the vessels through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Even for minimal and temporary changes in the blood pressure, the peripheral resistance acts, restoring the normal value of pressure. Shock is characterized by a permanent dilation of all the vessels, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. There is a systemic drop in the pressure. TYPES OF SHOCK cardiogenic shock: when there are problems at the level of the heart. There is a reduction in the heart rate or in its contractility. There is a low cardiac output due to myocardial pump failure. It’s typical of myocardial infarction (because in this case the heart is not able anymore to pump blood), ventricular rupture, ventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism (in case of obstruction), and cardiac tamponade (= accumulation of fluid, between the myocardium and pericardium, leading to a compression of the myocardium. It’s not anymore able to expand in a correct manner). The fluid that accumulates in cardiac tamponade can be an inflammatory edema (in case of myocarditis or endocarditis), a noninflammatory edema, or blood (in case of a rupture of the heart, at the level of a cardiac scar. It can rupture during myocardial infarction, because the myocardium cannot be repaired by the myocardial cells, hence the only way to repair it is the formation of a scar. The risk for these patients after infarction is that the scar can break and lead to hemorrhage). Student: about prolonged shock, how much time can it require to be fatal? Professor: It is possible to die even immediately for every type of shock. In a few seconds it is possible to die. In case of a hypoperfusion, it is not so severe: it is possible either to restore the blood pressure since it is possible to activate some compensatory mechanism, or the patient must reach the hospital to be treated. However shock can be distinguished in phases, and it is possible to die even after 1-2 minutes. The duration of the prolonged shock depends on the severity and on the organ failure. It is not possible to define only one possibility. The time depends on the damage. Student: How long a cellule can sustain hypoxia? Professor: They can sustain it for a few hours. However, in case of severe myocardial infarction, the patient dies immediately, because there is a severe necrosis of a large area of the heart. Any situation depends on our capacity to compensate and also on the capacity of the medical doctor to restore the condition. There is not a defined time, it depends on the damage. Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 62 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 hypovolemic shock: low cardiac output due to low blood volume (inadequate blood or plasma volume). The causes are severe hemorrhage, indeed it is called also hemorrhagic shock (blood loss of more than 30%), and severe fluid loss (vomiting for many days, diarrhea, severe burns, and trauma that lead to a decreased blood volume, and so there is a decrease in cardiac output). distributive shock: it’s associated with systemic inflammation (SIRS = systemic inflammatory response syndrome), which causes systemic vasodilation. Hence what is lost is a reduction in peripheral resistance due to a systemic vasodilation. All these inflammatory systemic diseases are characterized by a massive release of inflammatory mediators, in particular, histamine (it is the most responsible for vasodilation and also for the increase in permeability of the vascular wall.). There are 2 types of distributive shock: oIt’s typical in septic shock, caused by microbial and bacterial infections (mainly bacterial). In this situation, bacteria from the infective region diffuse in the circulation, leading to a systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators. The principal factor released is histamine, responsible mainly for systemic vasodilation and systemic permeability (hence there will be different edema distributed in the tissues). In the case of sepsis, there is a vasodilation and the pressure drops down. oAnaphylactic shock is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction, mediated by IgE, due to the presence of different antigens (drugs, hornet, wasp, bee and spider poisons, some foods, etc). After the first exposition of the antigen, generally, the patient doesn’t have problems, but starts to produce IgE antibodies, which bind to mast cells and basophils. During the second exposition of the antigen, the latter can bind to the IgE that are bound to the mast cells and basophils, which are both rich in granules containing histamine. The release of granules (degranulation) causes a release of a massive quantity of histamine that leads to vasodilation, so occurs a decrease in peripheral resistance, and the systemic increase in permeability (so edema and venous blood stasis), less commonly, vascular causes (obstructive shock) and nerve causes (neurogenic shock after a severe spinal cord injury). In all shock states, there is hypotension and insufficiency of peripheral perfusion (skin, muscles, kidney, bowel); reactive vascular processes (modification of vessel caliber and flow). STAGES OF SHOCK It’s possible to distinguish different stages, depending on the gravity of the event. If the event is massive and dramatic, the death is immediate; in the other conditions, which are less severe, the evolution is different: initial nonprogressive stage: this stage is still reversible, the body tries to compensate for the circulatory collapse: catecholamines are released and act as vasoconstrictors, there is the activation of the renin-angiotensin axis (absorption of Na+ and water → increase blood volume → increase blood pressure), ADH is released (increases blood volume, by stimulating reabsorption of water), there is sympathetic stimulation by the heart (can lead to tachycardia that increases heart rate, increase in the peripheral vasoconstriction at the level of skin, spleen, kidney, in order to concentrate the blood to the vital organs. The skin appears pale, and sweaty due to peripheral vasoconstriction, and cold. The vasoconstriction occurs peripherally but not in the vital organs, so as to still supply them.), and urine excretion is reduced (= oliguria) to maintain blood volume. Hence the body tries to increase blood pressure by increasing both the cardiac output and the peripheral resistance. The compensatory mechanisms used to compensate for the circulatory collapse consist in increasing heart rate (tachycardia), increasing the volume (oliguria), increasing the activation of the renin-angiotensin axis, and increasing the peripheral resistance (catecholamine release). Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 63 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 If the patient is not able to restore the damage and cellular injury, there is a progression of the shock: progressive stage. It is characterized by tissue hypoperfusion. After tissue hypoxia, there is a deficiency in oxygen, hence the aerobic metabolism is replaced by the anaerobic one, leading to the production of a large amount of lactate (lactic acidosis). This leads to the reduction of the pH and stasis at the level of the arterioles, in which the blood pools in the microcirculation. Slowly, because of hypoxia, cellular injury, and dysfunction of many vital organs, it will develop a Multi-Organ Failure. In particular, the first failure will be of the kidneys (renal insufficiency), with a follow fall in the urine output. irreversible stage: severe cellular and tissue injury. Survival is not possible anymore because a lot of organs are impaired (liver, heart, lungs, brain), in particular, kidneys because they can’t excrete urine (anuria). Eventually, the patient will die. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, tachypnea. non-reactive, skin with colorless or extreme pallor and cool (it’s only hot with septic shock due to fever caused by bacterial infection), cold sweat, cyanotic lips. dizziness and loss of consciousness depend on the reduction of cerebral perfusion. failure of organs that leads to death. - PATHOGENESIS OF SEPTIC SHOCK It’s responsible for more than 20% of deaths. Most frequently it is triggered by gram-positive bacterial infections, followed by gram-negative bacteria and fungi. There is a generalized inflammatory response, characterized by the activation of both inflammatory and immune cells, with the release of inflammatory mediators (histamine is the most important). There is also the release of many procoagulant factors. In the beginning (Fig. 8), there is the spreading of bacteria in all the circulation, followed by the activation of inflammatory immune cells, in particular those that present a toll-like receptor (TLR), that have a pro-inflammatory response (releasing cytokines and all the inflammatory mediators). However, the bacteria can also stimulate the release of the procoagulant factors. Then there is the endothelial activation and injury, with consequent dysfunction of the endothelium. It happens because the inflammatory response is not local, but is generalized, it affects all the body. The principal manifestations are vasodilation, increased permeability, and increased perfusion (can contribute to the MOF). Some pro-coagulation factors are stimulated, hence there is a reduction in the antifibrinolytic factors, which leads to the risk is the formation of a small thrombus in the vessels that can obstruct the circulation, hence disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC can be characterized by a hemorrhagic or thrombotic event. An increased presence of pro-coagulation factors and a reduced washout of activated coagulation factors can be responsible for the activation of thrombin and the formation of fibrin. Hence in the case of septic shock, there is the appearance of microvascular thrombosis. The presence of these thrombi in circulation can be responsible for ischemia, which can contribute to MOF. In the case of septic shock, there can be also the activation of the immune system and some systemic effects (fever, reduced myocardial contractility) that can contribute to MOF and finally to the death of the patient. Another point in a patient affected by septic shock is insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, because glucose can be uptaken by target cells through GLUT-4, and due to the release of many cytokines by inflammatory cells, cytokines can impair the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT-4) on the surface of target cells. Even if there is hyperglycemia, the patient is not diabetic, there is an alteration of glucose receptors. As a consequence, glucose cannot be used by the target cells as an energy source. It’s the reason why it’s easy to observe hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during septic shock. Question from 2021-2022 Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 64 04.05.2023 LEONARDUZZI L.5 Q: Does the absence of GLUT-4 cause ketoacidosis? A: Yes The last step is organ dysfunction, caused by systemic hypotension, interstitial edema, and small vessel thrombosis. It happens mainly in the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys. All these causes the death of the patient. Fig. 8 Luca Polizzi, Endi Dingu 65", "input": "", "output": "Hypertension & Shock\n\n**what mechanism regulate blood pressure?Blood pressure is defined as the product between the cardiac output and the peripheral resistance. Cardiac outputis regulated by heart rate and myocardial contractility (cardiac factors) and by blood volume (=stroke volume, which can change, according to the concentration of sodium and mineralocorticoids or with the release of atrial natriuretic peptide by the myocardium).The peripheral resistance can change according to vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Many factors can modulate the lumen of the vessels, such as humoral factors, that can be constrictors and dilators, local factors and neural ones, divided into constrictors and dilators. This latter can also regulate the heart rate and the contractility of the myocardium.**\n\n**what factors regulate blood volume?Blood volume is mainly regulated by renal Na+ excretion or reabsorption.Kidneys filter 170 L of plasma containing 23 nmoles of saltdaily.99.5% of filtered salt is reabsorbed, to maintain the total body concentration of Na+. 98% is reabsorbed by active sodiumtransporters, mainly ENaC (epithelial Na+channels), regulated by aldosterone which favors the reabsorption of Na+ and water. 1.5% is reabsorbed by epithelial sodium channels regulated by the renin-angiotensin system.**\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system: their aim is to maintain the blood volume in the circulatory system. Renin is produced in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys in response to: 1. low blood pressure in the afferent arterioles 2. elevated levels of catecholamines 3. low Na+ levels in the distal convoluted tubule, which occurs whtn GFR falls and there’s increased Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubules. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen produced by the liver, intoangiotensin I which in turn is converted into angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) by the enzyme ACE released by the vascular epithelium. Renin and angiotensin II induce the production of aldosterone by the adrenal gland. Aldosterone triggers the tubular system of the kidney to reabsorb more sodium. If the arteries of the kidney are over distended, the kidney will try to decrease the volume, lowering renin production. Consequently, aldosterone production is decreased, sodium and water retention decrease and the volume is reduced. This system takes some time,so the volume variation is evident in one or two days. The kidneys, at the same time, release not only vasoconstrictorelements but also vascular relaxing substances (PGs and NO) to counterbalance the vasopressor effect of angiotensin. Atrial Natriuretic peptide and Brain Natriuretic Peptide ANP/ BNP are produced by the heart following the degree of distension. So if there is high blood volume, the ventricles are more distended by the increased diastolic filling. This will increase the production of these peptides that induce increased sodium loss by the kidneys, and consequently water excretion causing a decrease in blood volume. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) Increases Water Reabsorption independent of sodium. The osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus sense the plasma osmolality and then the pituitary releases ADH accordingly. The most important renal action of ADH is to increase the water permeability of the distal tubule, collecting tubule, and collecting duct epithelia. This effect helps the body conserve water in circumstances such as dehydration. In the absence of ADH, the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water is low, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, a condition called diabetes insipidus. Thus, the actions of ADH play a key role in controlling the degree of dilution or concentration of the urine,\n\n**in general, when does hypertension develop?hypertension occurs when there is an increased cardiac output (due to increased blood volume, heart contractility / heart rate) or an increased total vascular resistance (due to changes in the activity of neural, humoral and local effectors). In some situations, both these parameters increase.**\n\n**what values define hypertension?To increase the blood volume, reaching the “threshold” ofhypertension, is only sufficient to increase the blood content of the arteries by 20-30 ml.According to the new criteria, hypertension is now defined as systolic pressure over 120 mmHg, or diastolic pressure over 80 mmHg.According to this new threshold, about 45% of the general population has hypertension.The threshold until recently was defined as 130 mmHg systolic and 85 mmHg diastolic.Depending on the value of blood pressure, it’s possible to classify the hypertension into five groups:**\n1. borderline → values between 140/90-95 mmHgmild → values between 140-159/95-99 mmHg 2. 3. moderate → values between 160-179/100-109 mmHg 4. severe → values between 180-209/110-119 mmHg 5. very severe → values > 210/>120 mmHg\n\n**what are the types of hypertension?**\nPRIMITIVE (essential) hypertension → very common (90-95%).Multifactorial. It usually occurs after 40 years old. Environmental factors: psychological stress, obesity, alcohol,smoking, physical inactivity, heavy salt consumption. Genetic factors: some polymorphisms induce excessiveRAAS activation → increased blood volume and blood pressure.There seems to be familial predisposition because it runs insome families. Mechanism: reduced renal Na+ excretion, even if the pressure isnormal. The result is an increase in blood volume and in cardiacoutput. In addition, there can also present an increase in theperipheral resistance. SECONDARY HYPERTENSION: it’s associated with many diseasesaffecting the kidneys, adrenal glands or other endocrine organs.Treating these diseases, we can reduce hypertension. Renal (most common) Chronic renal disease Acute glomerulonephritis Polycystic disease Renal artery stenosis → excess RAA activation →secondary hyperaldosteronism Renal vasculitis Renin-producing tumors What is the mechanism behind renal hypertension?narrowing (stenosis) of the renal artery (congenital; a mass;atherosclerotic plaque, etc) will cause low perfusion in theafferent arteriole → Juxtaglomerular cells will sense thisand increase Renin production in response, which will causean increase in aldosterone secretion (secondaryhyperaldosteronism)Diagnosis:■ doppler ultrasonography. Treatment:■ angioplasty Endocrine Adreno-cortical hyperfunction (Cushing syndrome, primaryaldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, etc.) Exogenous hormones: glucocorticoids, estrogen(pregnancy), oral contraceptives, sympathomimetics,tyramine-containing foods, MAO inhibitors. Pheochromocytoma → increased catecholamine secretion Acromegaly Hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism what is primary aldosteronism?80-90% of 2ry hypertension cases are due to primary aldosteronism.It is the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal gland → too much Na+ reabsorption → hypervolemia → high BP (how high will depend on the degree of hyper-secretion).It can be caused by a benign tumor in the adrenal cortex.Aldosterone will suppress renin, induce sodium-water retention, that in turn will suppress renin secretion. Hence, the condition would be of high aldosterone and low renin.Primary aldosteronism can also cause hypokalemia, In summary, in 1ry aldosteronism we will find:■ hypernatremia■ hypokalemia (late onset), since aldosterone is a potassium excretor■ metabolic alkalosis.■ inappropriate ARR How can pheochromocytoma cause high bp?neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal medulla (a sympathetic nucleus) that causes abnormally high catecholamine secretion.■ Noradrenaline binds to alpha receptors in the arteries and causes vasoconstriction.■ Adrenaline binds to beta receptors in the heart causing tachycardia, increases contractility, increasesconduction speed. it induces vasodilation in the arteries (but the effect is overcome by NE so netvasoconstriction) Sometimes we have secretion of some but not the others: Old clinical case of Paccotti: a patient came to the hospital with 300 systolic and he had pheochromocytoma, we rarely see in this condition a pure secretion of noradrenaline (although it might happen) and during the high bp episode the patient was bradycardic (30-40 bpm); this is because in this situation, the high bp (300) will induce bradycardia, a parasympathetic effect (no adrenaline secretion in this case). Noteworthy is the fact that each catecholamine works in a different way than the other Cardiovascular Coarctation of aorta Polyarteritis nodosa Increased intravascular volume Increased cardiac output Rigidity of the aorta Neurologic Psychogenic Increased intracranial pressure Sleep apnea Acute stress, including surgery\n\n**what is the labile phase of hypertension?At the beginning of the development of hypertension, it’s possible todistinguish an initial inconstant labile form, characterized by only anincrease in the cardiac output, whereas the peripheral resistance isnormal. Over time, the peripheral resistance increases until stabilizedhypertension is determined.High blood pressure stimulates hypertrophy of vascular SMCs (inparticular precapillary arterioles):**the muscular layer thickens and thelumen narrows permanently, which increases peripheral resistance.\n\n**clinical signs of hypertension?Hypertension is asymptomatic. Indeed, it is frequently called the“silent killer”.Secondary hypertension has clinical symptoms strictly associated withthe underlying disease. With time, symptoms of the effects ofhypertension on different organs may develop:**\nheart → LV hypertrophy → heart failure nervous system spasms, headache, vertigo, visual disturbances,necrosis of brain matter due to ischemia/microinfarction or tohemorrhage aorta → severe atheroma, abdominal aortic aneurysms kidney glomerular and tubular changes due to progressivenephron ischemia (chronic renal failure). hemorrhagic manifestations → nose, respiratory system, andfemale genital tract vessels → hypertrophy due to hypertension and, over time, adeposition of material in the EC space\n\n**Define shockSerious pathological event of acute circulatory insufficiency and itrepresents one of the primary causes of death.It is characterized by a reduction of cardiac output or reduction ofperipheral resistance; the consequence is a reduction in the bloodpressure → hypoperfusion of the main vital organs (circulatorycollapse)The two main symptoms of the shock are marked hypotension andhypoperfusion. At the beginning, if this condition is not so serious, itcan be reversible. But a prolonged shock leads to irreversible damage,causing the failure of many organs and, therefore, to the death of the patient.**\n\n**what are the different types of shock?We have 4 possibilities of shock:**\n1. Hypovolemic shock: usually due to acute hemorrhage, with decreased preload, low cardiac output and pulmonary pressure but high peripheral resistance (vasoconstriction) due to extreme sympathetic activation. Typical signs are paleness and sweating. 2. Cardiogenic shock: usually after a MI, with an increased preload, low cardiac output but high pulmonary pressure (Pulmonaryhypertension and edema and respiratory insufficiency) and high peripheral resistance. Paleness and sweating (Severe sympathetic reaction). 3. Distributive shock: it is the result of septic shock (due tobacterial infection) or anaphylactic shock(allergy). We have a very high cardiac output (with an otherwise normal heart) with normal to low pulmonary pressure and LOW peripheral resistance (massive vasodilation; unsustainably large vessels). Signs are red, dry and warm skin (No sympathetic activation here). 4. Obstructive shock (from a structure cardiopulmonary disease): pulmonary embolism or pericardial tamponade, low cardiac output, variable pulmonary pressure and high peripheral resistance.Paleness and sweating (Severe sympathetic reaction)\n\n**what are the stages of shock?1. non progressive stage:**the initial drop in blood pressurekickstarts mechanisms that for a while are able to compensate and keep the pressure from dropping too low:\nextreme sympathetic activation: peripheral vasoconstriction → sweating, pallor, oliguria, tachycardia RAAS activation ADH release 2. progressive state compensatory mechanisms are no longer enough, there is hypoperfusion, hypoxia and with thataccumulation of H+ and lactic acid that results in metabolic acidosis. If this situation lasts too long→ cell membrane and pumps dysfunction → necrosis 3. Irreversible stage → severe cellular and tissue injury. Survival is not possible anymore because a lot of organs are impaired, in particular kidneys because they can’t excrete urine (anuria).\n\n**explain the pathogenesis of septic shockSeptic shock causes more than 20% of all deaths.It is most frequently triggered by Gram+ bacteria, followed by Gram- and funghi.It consists of a generalized inflammatory response, mediated by bothinnate and adaptive immunity, extensive release of inflammatory mediators (histamine!!).**\n1. Bacteria spreads in the circulation, causing activation of the immune system, in particular cells ****that express toll-like receptor (TLR) → pro inflammatory response. 2. Endothelial dysfunction results from generalized inflammatory response. There’s vasodilation, increased permeability, activation of coagulant factors → procoagulant state. This is a risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 3. Cytokines can impair expression of GLUT-4 → hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during septic shock. 4. The last step is the organ dysfunction, caused by systemic hypotension, interstitial edema, small vessel thrombosis. It happens mainly in the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys. All these cause the death of the patient.

Multifactorial. It usually occurs after 40 years old. Environmental factors: psychological stress, obesity, alcohol, smoking, physical inactivity, heavy salt consumption. Genetic factors: some polymorphisms induce excessive RAAS activation → increased blood volume and blood pressure. There seems to be familial predisposition because it runs in some families. Mechanism: reduced renal Na+ excretion, even if the pressure is normal. The result is an increase in blood volume and in cardiac output. In addition, there can also present an increase in the peripheral resistance. SECONDARY HYPERTENSION: it’s associated with many diseases affecting the kidneys, adrenal glands or other endocrine organs. Treating these diseases, we can reduce hypertension. Renal (most common) Chronic renal disease Acute glomerulonephritis Polycystic disease Renal artery stenosis → excess RAA activation → secondary hyperaldosteronism Renal vasculitis Renin-producing tumors What is the mechanism behind renal hypertension? narrowing (stenosis) of the renal artery (congenital; a mass; atherosclerotic plaque, etc) will cause low perfusion in the afferent arteriole → Juxtaglomerular cells will sense this and increase Renin production in response, which will cause an increase in aldosterone secretion (secondary hyperaldosteronism) Diagnosis: ■ doppler ultrasonography. Treatment: ■ angioplasty Endocrine Adreno-cortical hyperfunction (Cushing syndrome, primary aldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, etc.) Exogenous hormones: glucocorticoids, estrogen (pregnancy), oral contraceptives, sympathomimetics, tyramine-containing foods, MAO inhibitors. Pheochromocytoma → increased catecholamine secretion Acromegaly Hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism what is primary aldosteronism? 80-90% of 2ry hypertension cases are due to primary aldosteronism. It is the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal gland → too much Na+ reabsorption → hypervolemia → high BP (how high will depend on the degree of hyper-secretion). It can be caused by a benign tumor in the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone will suppress renin, induce sodium-water retention, that in turn will suppress renin secretion. Hence, the condition would be of high aldosterone and low renin. Primary aldosteronism can also cause hypokalemia, In summary, in 1ry aldosteronism we will find: ■ hypernatremia ■ hypokalemia (late onset), since aldosterone is a potassium excretor ■ metabolic alkalosis. ■ inappropriate ARR How can pheochromocytoma cause high bp? neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal medulla (a sympathetic nucleus) that causes abnormally high catecholamine secretion. ■ Noradrenaline binds to alpha receptors in the arteries and causes vasoconstriction. ■ Adrenaline binds to beta receptors in the heart causing tachycardia, increases contractility, increases conduction speed. it induces vasodilation in the arteries (but the effect is overcome by NE so net vasoconstriction) Sometimes we have secretion of some but not the others: Old clinical case of Paccotti: a patient came to the hospital with 300 systolic and he had pheochromocytoma, we rarely see in this condition a pure secretion of noradrenaline (although it might happen) and during the high bp episode the patient was bradycardic (30-40 bpm); this is because in this situation, the high bp (300) will induce bradycardia, a parasympathetic effect (no adrenaline secretion in this case). Noteworthy is the fact that each catecholamine works in a different way than the other Cardiovascular Coarctation of aorta Polyarteritis nodosa Increased intravascular volume Increased cardiac output Rigidity of the aorta Neurologic Psychogenic Increased intracranial pressure Sleep apnea Acute stress, including surgery\n\n**what is the labile phase of hypertension?**\nAt the beginning of the development of hypertension, it’s possible to distinguish an initial inconstant labile form, characterized by only an increase in the cardiac output, whereas the peripheral resistance is normal. Over time, the peripheral resistance increases until stabilized hypertension is determined. High blood pressure stimulates hypertrophy of vascular SMCs (in particular precapillary arterioles): the muscular layer thickens and the lumen narrows permanently, which increases peripheral resistance.\n\n**clinical signs of hypertension?**\nHypertension is asymptomatic. Indeed, it is frequently called the “silent killer”. Secondary hypertension has clinical symptoms strictly associated with the underlying disease. With time, symptoms of the effects of hypertension on different organs may develop: heart → LV hypertrophy → heart failure nervous system spasms, headache, vertigo, visual disturbances, necrosis of brain matter due to ischemia/microinfarction or to hemorrhage aorta → severe atheroma, abdominal aortic aneurysms kidney glomerular and tubular changes due to progressive nephron ischemia (chronic renal failure). hemorrhagic manifestations → nose, respiratory system, and female genital tract vessels → hypertrophy due to hypertension and, over time, a deposition of material in the EC space\n\n**Define shock**\nSerious pathological event of acute circulatory insufficiency and it represents one of the primary causes of death. It is characterized by a reduction of cardiac output or reduction of peripheral resistance; the consequence is a reduction in the blood pressure → hypoperfusion of the main vital organs (circulatory collapse) The two main symptoms of the shock are marked hypotension and hypoperfusion. At the beginning, if this condition is not so serious, it can be reversible. But a prolonged shock leads to irreversible damage, causing the failure of many organs and, therefore, to the death of the patient.\n\n**what are the different types of shock?**\nWe have 4 possibilities of shock: 1. Hypovolemic shock: usually due to acute hemorrhage, with decreased preload, low cardiac output and pulmonary pressure but high peripheral resistance (vasoconstriction) due to extreme sympathetic activation. Typical signs are paleness and sweating. 2. Cardiogenic shock: usually after a MI, with an increased preload, low cardiac output but high pulmonary pressure (Pulmonary hypertension and edema and respiratory insufficiency) and high peripheral resistance. Paleness and sweating (Severe sympathetic reaction). 3. Distributive shock: it is the result of septic shock (due to bacterial infection) or anaphylactic shock(allergy). We have a very high cardiac output (with an otherwise normal heart) with normal to low pulmonary pressure and LOW peripheral resistance (massive vasodilation; unsustainably large vessels). Signs are red, dry and warm skin (No sympathetic activation here). 4. Obstructive shock (from a structure cardiopulmonary disease): pulmonary embolism or pericardial tamponade, low cardiac output, variable pulmonary pressure and high peripheral resistance. Paleness and sweating (Severe sympathetic reaction)\n\n**what are the stages of shock?**\n1. non progressive stage: the initial drop in blood pressure kickstarts mechanisms that for a while are able to compensate and keep the pressure from dropping too low: extreme sympathetic activation: peripheral vasoconstriction → sweating, pallor, oliguria, tachycardia RAAS activation ADH release 2. progressive state compensatory mechanisms are no longer enough, there is hypoperfusion, hypoxia and with that accumulation of H+ and lactic acid that results in metabolic acidosis. If this situation lasts too long→ cell membrane and pumps dysfunction → necrosis 3. Irreversible stage → severe cellular and tissue injury. Survival is not possible anymore because a lot of organs are impaired, in particular kidneys because they can’t excrete urine (anuria).\n\n**explain the pathogenesis of septic shock**\nSeptic shock causes more than 20% of all deaths. It is most frequently triggered by Gram+ bacteria, followed by Gram- and funghi. It consists of a generalized inflammatory response, mediated by both innate and adaptive immunity, extensive release of inflammatory mediators (histamine!!). 1. Bacteria spreads in the circulation, causing activation of the immune system, in particular cells ****that express toll-like receptor (TLR) → pro inflammatory response. 2. Endothelial dysfunction results from generalized inflammatory response. There’s vasodilation, increased permeability, activation of coagulant factors → procoagulant state. This is a risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 3. Cytokines can impair expression of GLUT-4 → hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during septic shock. 4. The last step is the organ dysfunction, caused by systemic hypotension, interstitial edema, small vessel thrombosis. It happens mainly in the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys. All these cause the death of the patient."}
