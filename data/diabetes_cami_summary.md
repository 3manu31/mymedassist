We can distinguish two types of amyloid depositions: 1. Systemic amyloidosis: Deposits are in various organs which are compromised from a morphological and functional point of view ◆primary systemic amyloidosis: associated with B cell disorders: AL AMYLOIDOSIS ◆secondary systemic amyloidosis: underlying chronic inflammatory process ◇ AA AMYLOIDOSIS ◇ AH (Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis) 2. Localized amyloidosis: Deposits only at the level of a specific organ ◆Primary ****(idiopathic) ◆Secondary ****to other pathological conditions Hereditary or familial amyloidosis constitute a separate, 3. although heterogeneous group, with several distinctive patterns of organ involvement.
