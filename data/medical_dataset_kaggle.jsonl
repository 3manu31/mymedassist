can create viral inhibitors for antiretrovirals\n- HIV-2 >>>\n    - less pathogenic & less easily transmitted than HIV-1\n    - primarilly found in West Africa\n    - HIV-2 has slower rate of disease progression & is associated w/ lower viral load\n- HIV  Life cycle >>>\n    - attachment - viral gp120 binds to host cell CD4 r. - target of some antiretrovirals\n    - fusion - viral gp41 meidates fusion - fusion inhibitors for retrovirals\n    - reverse transcription - reverse transcriptase converts viral RNA ⇒ to dsDNA -reverse transcriptase inhibitors \n    -
