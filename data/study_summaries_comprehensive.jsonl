prob in early 20th century\n    - 1987 first antiretroviral drug zidovudine\n    - 1996 development of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) - transforming HIV from fatal disease to chronic condition\n- structure >>>\n    - retrovirus w/ lipid envelope, matrix, capsid\n    - 2 RNA molecules\n    - 3 key enzymes - reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease (cleaves viral polyproteins into functional proteins) - each enzyme is a target for specific antiretroviral drugs\n    - viral envelope contains glycoproteins gp120 & gp41 - for viral entry into host cell\n    - genome includes structural proteins (gag, pol), regulatory proteins, & accessory proteins\n- classification >>>\n    - belongs to Lentivirus genus of Retroviridae family\n    - 2 main phylogenetic types: HIV-1 & HIV-2 - genetic diversity determines effectiveness of diagnostic & treatment strategies\n- glycoproteins >>>\n    - gp120 mediates attachment to host cell receptor CD4\n    - gp41 mediates fusion of viral & host cell membranes\n    - interaction between gp120 7 CD4 is highly specific, involving coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 - can create viral inhibitors for antiretrovirals\n- HIV-2 >>>\n    - less pathogenic & less easily transmitted than HIV-1\n    - primarilly found in West Africa\n    - HIV-2 has slower rate of disease progression & is associated w/ lower viral load\n- HIV  Life cycle >>>\n    - attachment - viral gp120 binds to host cell CD4 r. - target of some antiretrovirals\n    - fusion - viral gp41 meidates fusion - fusion inhibitors for retrovirals\n    - reverse transcription - reverse transcriptase converts viral RNA ⇒ to dsDNA -reverse transcriptase inhibitors \n    -
