CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTIONS  PROGRAM 1. Introduction and meningitis 2. Encephalitis and myelitis 3. Brain masses and septic complications of the CNS  SOURCES ● Mandell (8th edition) ● BIA guidelines   INTRODUCTION TO CNS INFECTIONS The CNS itself can be infected by several agents, including infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and helminths), but there are also a lot of conditions that can mimic CNS infections.1 An example is cancer, lymphoma can mimic a CNS infection, but also medications. Therefore, differential diagnosis is very important because timely treatment, in both scenarios, is crucial in order to avoid or at least reduce the number of long-term sequelae that these infections may have on the CNS.  The clinical presentation is often very acute and sudden. For example, in acute meningitis, a patient may develop fever, severe headaches and complications in a matter of hours or even minutes. There are also other scenarios which are sub-acute or chronic in which all the symptoms develop or worsen over weeks, and this may be a little more difficult to diagnose.  In fact, one of the key features of the CNS is that around the brain there is only a small amount of space and so any mass or any process that increases the amount of water in the cells, may compress several CNS structures that are very fragile. Therefore, complications may be very relevant and the urgency of dealing with them is of utmost importance.    THE DANISH STUDY GROUP OF INFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN DATABASE (DASGIB) In terms of data, Denmark is the best country for these studies, as they have all these centers in which they report all the clinical presentations and diagnosis of CNS infections. This (fig.1) is just to give you an idea of which are the most common conditions you might see. In this case viral meningitis is the most common, bacterial meningitis a bit less, while the third one is Lyme disease, but that is because it is Denmark and in all the Northern countries Lyme disease is a lot more frequent. After you see encephalitis, brain abscess and neurosyphilis.

Gervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   2 There are some general clinical manifestations of CNS infections, the most common being the triad of fever, headache and altered mental status.  There may also be meningism, which is related to the inflammation of the meninge although it may also be absent in several scenarios. The triad does not necessarily present together nor simultaneously; a patient may develop fever and then after a few days a headache and later on an altered mental status; or it can also be very sudden, with the patient presenting what resembles psychotic disorder or coma, i.e. altered mental status (either positive or negative, “up or down”). They may present seizures, which are a sign of CNS infection.  Clinical manifestations depend on: - The subject:  ● Age: if the patient is young (e.g. newborns) the signs and clinical presentation may be different and not the same as in adults. For instance, newborns do not lactate usually. Sometimes they present with what is called “encephalitis crying”, a high pitch, continuous cry.  ● Underlying conditions: patients with underlying conditions like dementia may be hard to diagnose as it is hard to capture changes in their mental status.  ● Surgery and trauma: neurosurgery can actually be a risk factor for some infections which are likely after these procedures. Trauma (e.g. at the base of the skull), can be a risk factor as well even after several years have passed, because the skull can be an entry point for pathogens into the CNS.  ● Immune system: immune depression is a risk factor for uncommon pathogens and presentations. For example, TB2 meningitis is uncommon in low prevalence countries (e.g. Italy), but it can be much more common in newborns and immunocompromised adults. - The microorganism (bacteria vs. viruses vs. mycobacteria...): bacteria usually cause a very acute presentation characterized by meningitis, whereas intracellular bacteria, like Borrelia (Lyme disease) may cause neuroborreliosis that is not that sudden in its presentation. TB meningitis for instance develops over weeks instead of hours. Viruses, such West Nile and Herpes Encephalitis3, have a much different onset.  - The focal involvement: involvement of certain brain areas leads to the development of specific symptoms, e.g. seizure, hemiplegia… Symptoms depend on the mass, how large it is, where it is and how large the edema around the brain mass is.

Structure ● Specialized areas: every area of the brain specializes in specific activities4, thus the effect of infections in different areas varies greatly. ● Neuronal regeneration has been observed in very specific areas (hippocampus and neuro-olfactory mucosa)5, but as a general rule when neurons die they are not regenerated. ● Gray matter vs. white matter: it’s important to differentiate pathologies that affect the gray matter (i.e. the cortex), causing commonly seizures, from those affecting the white matter, which may present with neurological involvement and often seizures. For instance, Progressive Multiple Leukoencephalopathy (a white matter infection caused by JC virus6) has a different clinical outcome compared to infections related to one of the lobes.  ● No anatomical barriers: there is no defined anatomical barrier between the brain, the meninges and the spinal cord, and therefore an infection may disseminate to all of these parts of the CNS.    2. Barriers  The most known barrier to the CNS is the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) (Fig.3a), now known as the neurovascular unit. It’s composed mostly of astrocytes end-feet, pericytes, and endothelial cells linked by tight junctions. It

There is also a blood-CSF barrier - the choroid plexus (Fig.3b). It’s located next to the ventriculi, and it actually represents a much easier way to cross the vascular vessels into the CSF, as it only consists of one or two layers of ependymal cells. This barrier is much easier to cross by viruses, drugs and toxins. These two barriers are different compartments, also in terms of permeability.  There are also some areas in the brain that are not covered by tight junctions, resulting in enhanced sensitivity towards drugs.7 An example is the area postrema8 in the 4th ventricle, which is one of the centers involved in vomiting. It is one of the most sensitive areas to drugs, as they can easily cross into the CNS.  3. Meninges  The meninges are located below the skull and are divided into 3 layers: the dura mater, arachnoid and pia mater. The dura mater is actually in contact with the bone and is the most bone-like structure. The pia mater is in direct contact with the cortex. If there is inflammation at the level of the pia mater, a lot of WBCs and chemokines are close to the cortex and inflammation affects the neurotransmission. The arachnoid contains villi responsible for reabsorbing CSF and it is the area most commonly involved in meningeal infection. Any alteration in the dimension of the meninges, even if very small, might affect the cortex, as they are very close. For this reason, in meningitis brain parenchyma involvement and seizure are common side  7 From the slides: Areas of no tight junctions (approx. 1/5000 of the surface): ● Hypothalamus (median eminence) ● Fourth ventricle (area postrema) ● Third ventricle (subfornical organ) 8 From Wikipedia: The area postrema, a paired structure in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem, is a circumventricular organ having permeable capillaries and sensory neurons that enable its dual role to detect circulating chemical messengers in the blood and transduce them into neural signals and networks. Such roles of the area postrema include its detection of circulating hormones involved in vomiting, thirst, hunger, and blood pressure control.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) The average amount of cerebrospinal fluid is 150mL. There have been studies that say that if you collect CSF slowly in a lumbar puncture, you can take up to 45 mL. Usually, we take only 10mL in a lumbar puncture.  It is produced by the choroid plexus of each ventricle and then flows freely into the subarachnoid space and into the spinal cord and rest of the brain. From the subarachnoid space, it is absorbed into dural venous sinuses via the arachnoid villi. Any problem in this circulation is dangerous. For example, some cases of meningitis may affect the amount of proteins in the CSF and cause arachnoiditis (inflammation of arachnoid space) which may lead to an increased CSF pressure and hindrance of the circulation. This leads to an enlargement of ventriculi and symptoms due to compression of several structures.    The CSF is not static. 2/3 of CSF is obtained through ultrafiltration of plasma, while the remaining 1/3 comes from the brain extracellular fluid. It is therefore a mix of plasma and brain interstitial fluid. It does not derive only from the brain. The CSF is produced and reabsorbed completely around 3-4 times per day, but its production rate is affected by age (lower in extreme ages), cerebral perfusion pressure, drugs (e.g. diuretics), and circadian variations (e.g. the rate in the morning may differ from the one in the afternoon). 5. Lymphatics In the past, it was actually believed that there were no lymphatic vessels in the CNS. However, in 2015 the presence of some lymphatic vessels next to the meningeal spaces was demonstrated. They are not fully developed vessels, but anatomically delimited spaces in which the lymph may flow. It is then drained, usually into the nasal associated lymphatic tissue next to the olfactory nerve and then to the deep neck cervical lymph nodes.  Before, it was thought that the immune tolerance in the brain was almost total, while in recent years it has been understood that there is actually some immune control in the brain, and some T and few B lymphocytes Fig.  SEQ

Lumbar puncture is a maneuver performed in order to withdraw CSF. It is usually performed with the patient in a lateral recumbent position on a firm surface with the back at the edge of the table/bed, or sitting with their back curved.  The patient has to be reassured with the help of a nurse by explaining what they will experience in terms of pain, when they will feel the needle, and by telling them that they might feel some kind of electrical shock in the legs. It’s a sterile maneuver, and some time should be taken to prepare for it. It’s usually performed between L3 and L4, but can also be done between L2 and L3 because usually the spinal cord ends between T12 and L1 (so there is no risk of harming it).  The reference point is the iliac crest. Touching it with the second finger and putting the first finger in the middle of the back usually gives the location of L3 and L4. After a lumbar puncture, patients should lie in bed with a pillow for at least 2 hours. Some people suggest remaining in a prone position, but there is no evidence-based information on this.  The patient should be told about the complications of lumbar puncture. They are listed below: 1. Headache (10-25%): in 1-3% is orthostatic (worsens when standing up, leading to a severe headache, so the patient usually goes back to bed and it may last weeks). It’s not common, but in some cases the headache may last several days, making patients unwilling to repeat the puncture in the future. The headaches are believed to be associated with CSF leakage at the site of puncture and not with the amount removed. Therefore, 10-15 and even up to 25-30mL of CSF can be safely withdrawn. In research setting, U.S. physicians withdraw very slowly 50 mL of CSF, but usually 7-15 mL is pretty safe in normal conditions.  Automatic needles9 may be associated with a steep reduction in headaches.   In cases of very severe persistent (days) headache after a lumbar puncture, “blood patches” may be used by neurosurgeons in order to close the small hole in the dura mater made during the puncture.  2. Infections: very uncommon if the procedure is performed in a sterile manner. Even if the puncture is performed in a patient with bacteremia (in order to understand whether it’s just sepsis or if it’s a CNS infection), the risk of CSF infection caused by the maneuver itself is very low. Instead, lumbar puncture  9 They will be discussed later.

Gervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   7 should be avoided in case of an established infection in the lumbar space (such as spinal epidural abscess, spinal subdural empyema, or some superficial or deep paraspinal infection than can be clearly seen on the skin).  3. Local bleeding: usually mild unless coagulation disorders are present. Coagulation parameters (platelet count, PT and PTT) should be checked before performing a lumbar puncture.  4. Brain herniation: the most relevant complication in terms of consequences. It’s usually the cerebellar tonsils that may be herniated and compress the brainstem, causing death during LP. The compression of the brainstem may lead to severe cardiovascular complication such as inhibition of respiration/breathing, extreme tachypnea, severe tachycardia and cardiac death. It is very uncommon. It has been observed in patients with severe intracranial pressure. The highest risk is represented by masses in the posterior fossa, so mostly in the cerebellum (dislocation of brainstem and cerebrum). In high-resource countries, before doing LP, it is important to ask for a brain image and perform a CT scan in ALL patient before undergoing the lumbar puncture, since it’s fast, does not have severe contraindications and provides information about brain masses. A neurosurgeon should also be asked to assess the risk of brain herniation. The problem is that in the poor countries of the world with limited resources, we do not have a CT scan. There a certain signs that suggest to defer LP. LP should be deferred in case of clinical signs of impending herniation: - Deteriorating level of consciousness: if the GCS10 is below 11 and if the deterioration was fast, lumbar puncture must not be done. The patient should be treated as if he had bacterial meningitis or encephalitis, and the doctor should try to understand what is going on. - Brainstem signs, including pupillary changes, posturing and/or irregular respiration. These are signs of potential damages to the brainstem, so LP should never be performed without a previous brain imaging since it may be harmful. - Very recent seizures: they may be a sign of the presence of brain masses.  HOW TO MEASURE INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE (IPC)11 There are several research tools for the evaluation of ICP, but the most important ones in clinical practice are:  1. Brain imaging (CT/MRI): indirect way of measuring ICP which provides information about brain masses.  2. Fundus oculi exam: upon checking the fundus oculi (the inner posterior portion of the eye), papilledema, a sign of increased CSF pressure, may be visible.  However, the sign shows up with a delay, so an acute rise in ICP may be missed with this method.  3. Ocular nerve ultrasound: in resource-limited settings where ultrasound is available, several studies suggest the observation of the ocular nerve thickness, which is said to be directly proportional to the ICP.  A very recent study (Fig.10) was carried out last year to evaluate if performing a brain imaging before a lumbar puncture would actually delay the initiation of treatment. The times between emergency department  10 Glasgow Coma Scale 11 The professor suggests the article “Invasive and noninvasive means of measuring intracranial pressure: a review” published by Xuan Zhang et al. in 2017

  Fig. 10  LUMBAR PUNCTURE – THE NEEDLE In the bottom of Fig.11 there is a traumatic needle. This type of needle may damage the dura mater by cutting it and leaving a hole. In the top, instead, an atraumatic needle (Sprotte or Panjunk) in pictured. The tip is more similar to that of a pencil, so this needle doesn’t cause much damage to the dura mater. The dura mater contains nervous fibers that might be damaged directly by the maneuver, and the CSF might leak out from the hole induced by a traumatic needle. For this reason, atraumatic needles are now considered the best way to perform LP. Using them, complications such as headaches, are reduced to less than 3%. They have now been used for the last 5-6 years and post-LP headaches have become really uncommon.

Normal values of CSF:  ● Opening pressure: not really a routine measure but it can be done easily; it should be around 50-195 mm H2O. ● Appearance: should be clear and colorless ● Cell count: the CSF contains some cells, mostly lymphomonocytes, but usually less than 5 cells/mm3 ● Glucose: should be measured at the same time as a contemporary glycemia test. Usually, a finger test for glycemia is carried out right at the end of the lumbar puncture procedure in order to have two comparable values. However, in some settings, like in the emergency room, the blood test may be done in the morning and the LP in the afternoon, so glycemia is not contemporary. Value should be >50% of contemporary glycemia. ● Proteins: <45-55 mg/dL ● (Chloride): Some laboratories also test chloride levels, which provide information about inflammation and risk of bacterial infection.

Traumatic lumbar puncture is a common consequence whereby peripheral blood is introduced into the CSF distorting the true cell counts. The CSF correction of white blood cell count (WBC) equation (reported above) was derived to reflect the true CSF WBC count through accounting for and excluding contributions from the peripheral blood.14  The absence of CSF WBCs does not rule out encephalitis. Actually, in 5% of cases of Herpes Encephalitis the cell count is normal during first lumbar puncture, while a second LP performed 48-72 hours later presents leukocytosis (increased number of WBCs in the CSF).  Xanthochromia Xanthochromia15 is the yellow or yellow-orange supernatant of centrifuged CSF. It is reported by the lab together with the results of the CSF tests. It is usually due to lysis of RBC16 and it is usually more common in early stages17. It is observed in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage, while traumatic LPs have clear supernatants because the RBC are usually intact since there is not enough time for RBC hemolysis to occur. It might also be observed when there is a very high level of proteins in the CSF (>150 mg/dL) or in case of jaundice.   Additional Tests Additional tests may also be employed depending on the clinical picture. These tests may be:  - Reibergrams - Anti-CNS antibodies: relevant for immune disorders in the CNS - Anti-aquarporin4 (Anti-AQP4): in the spectrum for neuromyelitis Optica (Devic syndrome) - Prionic protein/14-3-3: used for Creutzfeldt-Jakob and related disorders - CXCL13: cytokine secreted by T lymphocytes to attract B-lymphocytes; it is highly specific for neuroborreliosis and neurosyphilis, but it’s still under research.  There are a lot of markers that can be used in research setting, but we are not required to know them. [From the slides: AD biomarkers (Tau, p-tau, 1-42 𝛽-amyloid); Astrocytosis (S100Beta); Inflammation (Neopterin); Axonal damage (NFL)].  Reibergram This technique is quite old but cheap.

In Fig.13 there is a depiction of what might be seen. According to the position of the dots, different scenarios might be recognised. The orange line provides an index of BBB impairment. A high albumin ratio (seen by moving along the orange arrow towards the top-right portion of the graph, ed.) reflects an increased concentration of albumin, which is a big molecule, in the CSF, indicating a leakage through the BBB and therefore an impairment of the barrier. On top of the orange arrow, the purple line represents the production of IgG in the CNS. So, after correcting this value for albumin concentration, the amount of IgGs produced in the CNS - related to those in the periphery - can be checked. It is a measure of intrathecal inflammation, hence it indicates whether there is an ongoing inflammatory process and how many of these immunoglobulins are being produced locally. Overall, it’s very cheap and can help to get an idea of the situation. Subsequent tests define if the IgGs are monoclonal, polyclonal or oligoclonal. Oligoclonal IgGs in the CSF is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a disease characterized by an autoimmune process in the brain.  MENINGITIS Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges and/or of the CSF, i.e. the liquid within the meninges. The onset of meningeal symptoms is usually acute, over a matter of hours or at most a few days. There are also some forms of chronic meningitis in which symptoms appear over a time span of a few weeks or months (usually > 4 weeks), but they are very uncommon.  PRIMARY CLASSIFICATION Meningitis can be divided into bacterial and aseptic.  ● Bacterial meningitis usually presents an unclear purulent CSF, which might appear yellowish or whitish. The CSF contains an elevated number of cells, up to thousands, mostly granulocytes and neutrophils. At the beginning of this process there might be a predominant increase of lymphocytes. Other findings in the CSF include elevated levels of proteins and low glucose concentration18. It’s mainly due to bacteria, whereas other causes (such as Amoeba or Cerebral abscesses) are less common. It is important to remember that since some of these bacteria are transmittable person-to-person, the patient should be isolated.   ● Aseptic meningitis: CSF is clear and colorless, with sometimes “dust-like” particles. The number of cells, usually lympho-monocytes, is elevated but usually to a lower extent compared to bacterial meningitis. Protein concentration is also elevated but again, not as much as for BM. Glucose concentration is normal, because viruses do not use glucose (the same is true for intracellular bacteria). Etiological agents may be viruses, intracellular bacteria (Leptospira, Brucella, Borrelia...), or partially treated bacterial meningitis. In fact, a patient at home with bacterial meningitis who has  18 Glucose concentration is low because it is consumed by the bacteria.

Always ask patients if they have been taking antibiotics.  The orange line (last row) in Fig.14 represents an exception of aseptic meningitis in which the CSF appears clear, the cell count remains in the same range as before, maybe consisting of lymphomonocytes and neutrophils at the beginning, but there is very high level of proteins and low glucose levels. In this case, the main suspicion is Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; to sum up, TB meningitis has very clear CSF presentation, resembling aseptic meningitis, but glucose is heavily consumed. Fungi could also be a possible cause but a 
pretty rare one.   EPIDEMIOLOGY ● Bacterial Meningitis The two most common causes are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis, but it may also be due to Haemophilus influenzae. In general, Bacterial Meningitis is not common, but the situation changes from country to country. In western countries (Finland, Netherlands, and the United States) the incidence is 0.7-0.9 per 100,000 people/year, and over time in the last 30 years the prevalence has reduced thanks to vaccination. In some African countries like Burkina Faso and Malawi the incidence is still very high, 10-40 per 100,000 people/year.   ● Aseptic meningitis: - Predominantly caused by Enteroviruses - In the US 30-75,000 cases/year - Predominance of infection during summer and fall in areas with a temperate climate because people spend more time outdoor, while in areas with tropical climates the infection is present all year round - It’s spread from person-to-person mainly through fecal-oral transmission, although houseflies, wastewater and sewage may contribute to the spread  - It may affect both children and adults  - Risk factors such as rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, have been associated with a higher chance of presenting aseptic meningitis

They are usually due to non-B serotypes, mostly serogroup A, although after the MenA19 vaccination (2010) C, Y, W135 and X have also been more common20.   There is a higher risk during dry season (December-June); the suspicion is that the dust particles may carry the meningococci leading to a larger spread which may cause several epidemics. Every 5-10 years21 there is a large-scale epidemic in the area. Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia are requested a certification of vaccination in order to the avoid spread.   MENINGITIS VALUES IN ITALY  In 2015 and 2016 there has been a rise in meningitis C cases in Italy, for which Tuscany was the epicenter and actually the only region involved. In Piedmont there were around 10-15 cases every year, but in Tuscany the number of cases was its double in 2015 and triple in 2016. It was mostly due to meningococci C, even in vaccinated patients. It therefore raised questions about its virulence and about the effectiveness of the vaccination.

Aseptic meningitis is the most common form, with an incidence of 50-100 cases every year, while the incidence of bacterial meningitis (mostly meningococcal meningitis) is around 10-15 cases every year. In both cases the trend has remained quite stable over the last 7 years. However, in the last years, the incidence has reduced to almost zero, because of mask usage but also because Piedmont started to have vaccination for the Meningococcus B strand.   This (fig.18) is a graph showing the effect of vaccination on the etiology. You can see that overtime, when the 
vaccine was introduced, for example H. influenzae vaccine, N. meningitis vaccine, there has been a steep reduction of the strains. The one that is still present is S. pneumoniae, because the vaccination is reserved for people over 65 and those with chronic lungs problems, and is not that effective. The primary cycle of the vaccine is administered very young, and it protects from pneumonia below the age of five. When people are older they get revaccinated.  From fig. 19, it is possible to see that there is a very strong age determinant. For example, some of these affects only newborns, like S. agalactiae. N. menigitis as well is mostly see in the young ones, below the age of 20. S. pneumoniae is more common below the age of 5 (that’s why we vaccinate children) but then is again present below the age of 65.

Over time, there has been a steep decrease of Neisseria and Haemophilus infections due to the widespread vaccination, and therefore the incidence is actually lower than the values previously mentioned, so although it varies depending on the country, it may even be as low as 0.1cases/100K people/year24. There is a lot of risk factors for the development of meningitis, for example immunodepression and splenectomy, because people without  22 a.k.a.

Gervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   16 spleen have a higher risk of capsulated bacterial infection.   ● Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus Pneumoniae is the main cause of meningitis in patients above the age of 20, so it has to be suspected in adults. The most important risk factors are sinusitis and otitis media. Most of the patients have a history of sinusitis or ear pain that has not been treated. This is because the bacteria colonize the sinuses or the ear and after that they can create a contact and get directly into the meninges. Performing a CT scan, it is possible to notice bone involvement and perforation, which allows bacteria to cross and enter into the CNS.   CT scans are essential: first, because they detect the presence of masses. Among the numerous bacteria, there is one able to relocate from the throat to the circulation and then to reach the brain, where it replicates leading to a very high bacterial load, which results in severe clinical manifestations.25 The second reason is that entry points to the brain should be repaired. If a patient has a damaged bone wall, this must be repaired immediately to prevent recurrent meningitis by pneumococci. The professor had a patient who had meningitis from streptococcus seven times, because he had rhino-liquorrhea due to a small damage in the skull bone. They saw the damage with a CT scan and repaired it. Moreover, people who had traumatic damages to their skull, for example after a motorcycle accident, have a higher risk of developing meningitis in their life.  There are other less common risk factors such as pneumonia, alcohol abuse, diabetes, splenectomy, hypogammaglobulinemia, complement deficiency, fracture of the skull base, and rhino-liquorrhea (more due to damage in the bone structure).  Mortality is still quite high, around 18-26%, and in older adults it rises to 30-35%.  ● Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria meningitis is most common in children and young adults (2-20 years of age).  Epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis occur only in 2% of cases, while the remaining 98% of cases are sporadic. There are differences in different strains in terms of virulence. Some deficiencies in humoral immunity or complement (C6 to C9) might explain the difference in vulnerability in different individuals. However, usually the first step consists of a transient nasopharyngeal colonization, which can be observed in 5-10% of the normal population. Then the bacteria might outgrow and give rise to an invasive disease with a mortality of around 10%26 (much lower than Pneumococcus but still quite relevant).  One of the warning/alert signs that should be explained to the children’s mothers is the presence of petechiae, which are usually very relevant in the course of the infection and can be the first step of a fulminant disease, leading to death within few hours after the onset of the petechiae. So, a child with very 
 25 This is my best interpretation of what the professor says in slide 36 (00:47): “First, because it tells you something about (body/bony?) mass. There is a lot of bacteria; there is just one bacterium that was in the throat, gets in the circulation and went to the brain. Here there is a very high bacterial load and for this reason the severity of the disease is very high.”  A better explanation may be found from the article “Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Pneumococcal Meningitis”: The most common route of infection starts by nasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which must avoid mucosal entrapment and evade the host immune system after local activation. During invasive disease, pneumococcal epithelial adhesion is followed by bloodstream invasion and activation of the complement and coagulation systems. The release of inflammatory mediators facilitates pneumococcal crossing of the blood-brain barrier into the brain, where the bacteria multiply freely and trigger activation of circulating antigen-presenting cells and resident microglial cells. The resulting massive inflammation leads to further neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, resulting in the well-known features of bacterial meningitis 26 From the slides: Mortality 3-13% 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7

systemic illnesses, procedure-related and some miscellaneous causes) of symptoms that are similar to acute meningitis. This gives an idea of the complexity of the differential diagnosis of meningitis.   ASEPTIC MENINGITIS – ETIOLOGY Enteroviruses are a large group of viruses, there is cocksackievirus, echovirus, poliovirus. They are neurotrophic, that is why they can infect the brain. Another important group is the arboviruses. A common question the professor asks to students at the exam is: “when you think about meningitis, when you perform a lumbar puncture and you can see a clear CSF, so an aseptic meningitis, which are the viruses you think first?” and the answer is enteroviruses and arboviruses.

For example, Staphylococcus aureus infection is sometimes observed in hospitalized patients and after neurosurgery. Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae may also be present in patients that have been hospitalized with severe co-morbidities and after neurosurgery. Haemophilus Influenzae Type B is sometimes observed in children, more commonly in the USA than in Europe, but unvaccinated children are more prone to this infection.  Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) is usually observed in elderly but also in newborns, so mothers are screened for the presence of GBS in the vagina.   ● Listeria monocytogenes One important causative agent of meningitis is Listeria monocytogenes, which usually causes an aseptic meningitis27, but sometimes the CSF is not clear. It might be observed in newborns, pregnant women, elderly and immune deficient patients including homeless people, cirrhotic patients, end-stage kidney-diseased patients and alcohol abusers.28 The epidemics in the last years have involved foie gras, watermelons from Australia, and carne mechada from Spain. So, there are different foods that can carry Listeria bacterium, although in the beginning only cheese was thought to be involved, mostly soft cheeses. That is why pregnant women are suggested to not eat them, because listeria infection in pregnancy can be dangerous both for the mother and the fetus.  Listeria infection is therefore a foodborne disease and quite uncommon, affecting 3-6 people/1 million/year in Italy.  A French study conducted by MONALISA29 collected all the cases with a 2 year follow up and reported the different presentations associated with Listeria infection.  27 This is what the professor says. However, several sources on the Internet claim that it’s a bacterial meningitis, not aseptic (e.g. the article “Aseptic and Bacterial Meningitis: Evaluation, Treatment, and Prevention” by H. R. Mount et al.). 28 From the slides: Older age, innate and cellular immune defects, malignances, HIV infection, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and immunosuppressive therapies. 29 “Clinical features and prognostic factors of listeriosis: the MONALISA national prospective cohort study” by Chralier C. et al.

The cases were divided into maternal cases (i.e. during pregnancy), bacteremia (i.e. patients in which Listeria was isolated in blood cultures) and neurolisteriosis (in which there was CNS involvement). As shown, patients with neurolisteriosis were older, with an average age of 67, and they had some comorbidities (around 3 per patient). 97% of patients presented fever, whereas diarrhea and septic shock were not so common. The Glasgow Coma Scale was 12, which is a relevant value. 2/3 of the patients had positive blood cultures for Listeria once the CNS was involved.  In fig.24, the mortality rates recorded by the study are shown. In the graph on the left (A), the red line (lower) indicates bacteremia cases (46%), whereas the green (middle) represents neurological cases (30%). It is possible to see that the mortality in bacterial cases (blue line) is very low, 0%. Mortality was “intermediate” in patients with neurological symptoms. This may be due to the fact that neurological cases allowed a rapid recognition of the problem, while bacteremia was more difficult to recognize because the symptoms were pretty a-specific. However, in graph on the right (B) it can be noticed that the neurological cases that had

Neurolisteriosis patients receiving adjunctive dexamethasone also displayed an increased mortality.30 For both bacteremia and neurolisteriosis, the strongest mortality predictors/risk factors are: - Ongoing cancer - Multiple Organ Failure - Aggravation/worsening of any preexisting organ dysfunction  - Lymphomonocytopenia31  
Therapy for listeria is ampicillin, pretty common and can be used for many infections, and all patients above the age of 60 or immunocompromised with a suspicion of listeriosis should receive the antibiotic.             PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  30 From the slides. 31 Lymphomonocytopenia is seen in several infections. The pathogenesis is unknown. It is a prognostic factor in viral pneumonia, such as Covid-19 disease, which will be dealt with later during the course.

It is then followed by local invasion, often bacteremia, invasion of the meninges, then a process of microvascular invasion starts, with macrophages, neutrophils and other CNS cells releasing cytokines, leading to subarachnoid space inflammation and possibly cerebral vasculitis and cerebral infarction. Remember that most of these infections are associated with secondary vasculitis and vascular problems in the CNS.  In Fig.26, some of the bacterial and host features that might favor each of these steps are depicted. Some of these may favors mucosal colonization, intravascular survival, meningeal invasion or survival in the subarachnoid space – all of these may increase persistence, invasiveness and pathogenicity of this bacteria.                     ● Aseptic meningitis There are different ways for viruses to reach the CNS32.  1. Mucosal colonization involving either the peri-tonsillar lymphatics or Peyer’s patches in the gut, leading then to viremia and finally to the crossing of the BBB by the viral particles 2. Some viruses are carried by leukocytes (e.g. Measles, Mumps, Herpes) 3. Directly enter the CNS by crossing the choroid plexus 4. Olfactory nerves may also be a way of entry (e.g. influenza) 5. Peripheral nerves may also be a route entry into the CNS (e.g. Herpes virus).      CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS   32 This topic will be discussed in more detail when dealing with the pathogenesis of encephalitis.

Others signs and symptoms like vomiting, seizures, focal neurological findings and papilledema may vary. ● In neonates, however, the clinical manifestations are different. Meningismus is usually absent, and newborns may present instead temperature instability (hypo- or hyperthermia), listlessness35, high-pitched crying, fretfulness, lethargy, refusal to feed, weak suction, irritability, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, or respiratory distress.  ● In very young children, bulging fontanelle36 may be observed. Neck stiffness, seizures (outside the febrile-convulsion age range), and reduced food intake37 are also typically found in children. ● In adults, fever, nuchal rigidity and altered mental status are seen only in 2/3 of the patients. The classical case is very easy to recognize, but in 1/3 of cases there are uncommon symptoms that might render the diagnosis more difficult. Also, depending on whether patients took antibiotics, there could be the presentation of different or less common signs.   Fig.28 depicts a patient intubated because of a pneumococcal meningitis. Notice how his body is covered by numerous petechiae. The intubation is required in order to protect the airways since the value of the Glasgow Coma Scale is so low that the patient is unable to breathe autonomously.    
 In order to provide clear advice to families, the meningitis glass test may be employed (fig.29). The presence  33 Meningismus = A state of meningeal irritation with symptoms suggesting meningitis.  34 From Wikipedia: A clouded sensorium, also known as an altered sensorium, is a medical condition characterized by the inability to think clearly or concentrate. 35 From Dictionary.com: Listlessness = having or showing little or no interest in anything; languid; spiritless; indifferent: a listless mood. 36 The presence of bulging fontanelle usually worries the mothers. Once, the professor has seen such a big bulging fontanelle that it has very hard and impossible to be pressed back into the skull. The following information was provided by the sbobinatore: A fontanel, also called fontanelle, is more commonly known as a soft spot. When a baby’s born, they typically have several fontanels where bones of their skull haven’t fused yet. A newborn has fontanels on the top, back, and sides of their head. Changes in texture or appearance can be a sign of serious health issues. Parents should watch for soft spots that are curved outward on their baby’s head and feel very firm. This is known as a bulging fontanel and may be a sign of brain swelling or fluid buildup in the brain. A bulging fontanel is an emergency. It can be a sign of pressure rising inside the skull which may result in damage to the baby’s developing brain. 37 From the slides.

They may also present a rash and upper respiratory tract symptoms such as cough. Sometimes also nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelle are present. In newborns, outcomes may be very severe when infection occurs early on, i.e. through transplacental transmission, which may lead to Multiple Organ Failure.  ● In children and adults, fever is usually present and it may be biphasic – an acute early fever followed by a later second rise in temperature. 50% of the patients present nuchal rigidity, usually with headache and photophobia38, often accompanied by non-specific symptoms including: ■ pleurodynia39, herpangina40, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease41 caused by Coxsackievirus, which are a subfamily of Enteroviruses ■ scattered maculopapular rash caused by Echovirus 9 ■ pleural and pericardial effusion caused by Coxsackievirus B42 ■ enteroviruses, typically Enterovirus 71, can lead to some severe syndromes in older children (mortality up to 14%).  Fig.30 shows a patient with herpangina, a typical symptom associated with aseptic meningitis. It is one of the oral manifestations of enterovirus infection, and it is characterized by ulcers on the back of the throat which cluster together in the same area. SIGNS OF MENINGITIS  There are several signs that a neurologist should look for in a patient with meningitis. The most important two according to the professor’s opinion are the neck rigidity (Brudzinski sign) and the Kernig sign.  In meningitis, the neck is stiff making the patient unable to bend the neck over the chest, and its passive flexion by the physician causes flexion of both legs and thighs (Brudzinski sign).  The Kernig sign is positive when a patient lying down with the hip flexed at 90° cannot fully extend the knee.  All these signs are signs of inflammation of the meninges and of the spinal nerves, and are due to the involuntary attempt of the patient to reduce the pain caused by these maneuvers. The position of meningitis patients is the lateral position, with the head extended and the eyes closed, and they do not move. This is very typical of meningitis, as every movement is painful. 
 38 Photophobia = extreme sensitivity to light 39 Pleurodynia = severe pain in the muscles between the ribs or in the diaphragm, caused typically by Coxsackie B 40 Herpangina, also called mouth blisters, is a painful mouth infection caused by coxsackieviruses, usually coxsackievirus A 41 Hand, foot, and mouth disease: A common illness of infants and children under 10 years old characterized by fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters due to infection most commonly with coxsackievirus A16 or less often enterovirus 71 or another enterovirus. 42 From the slides: Coxsackievirus A -> herpangina while B -> pleural and pericardial effusion Fig. 30

Gervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   24  Fig. 31 Another sign of meningitis that has been recently introduced is the jolt accentuation of headache. It is performed by rotating 1-2 times the head of a patient with headache, resulting in a steep accentuation of the pain. The professor doesn’t consider this test to be very specific for meningitis, as no one would be very happy to have their head rotated if they had a headache, which would probably worsen after this maneuver.  DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis is based on the CSF analysis. In bacterial meningitis, gram staining (often positive) and culture exam (positive in 70-90% of the cases) are needed. Bacterial antigens may be obtained quickly (usually within one hour), and even though their sensitivity is not very high (70%), specificity is approximately 100%. PCR is the most sensitive and specific technique both for bacterial and aseptic meningitis.  Bear in mind that stool or throat swabs for enteroviruses have a specificity for 96%, so they might be useful.    There are also some scores that might be helpful. For example, the Bacterial Meningitis Score suggests that

Lactate can also be used for the differential diagnosis between bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Elevated CSF lactate concentration suggests bacterial meningitis, for which it shows a sensitivity of 93-97% and a specificity of 94-96%, better than some other CSF parameters.43  FILM ARRAY It is possible to perform multiple PCRs, i.e. PCRs that are carried out at the same time for two different targets. This technique is called film array, and it covers the most important bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus B, Escherichia coli), yeasts like Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii and the most important viruses44 (Enterovirus, Herpes 1 to 6, Human parechovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Cytomegalovirus). The results can be available in 2-6 hours, which can be very helpful in targeting treatment.   COMPLICATIONS  There are many. In the case of bacterial: DIC, sepsis and shock. There are several neurological complications, including cranial nerve palsies, that can be examined by pressing the cranial nerves inducing palsies. Other complications include seizures, focal signs, hydrocephalus. The latter is caused by CSF cannot flow, so the ventricles enlarge and this can induce coma. There are also several sub-acute and chronic complication. A complication very important in children is neurodevelopmental delay.   MANAGEMENT ● Rapid initiation of antimicrobial treatment is fundamental and it’s the first thing to do. It should be initiated within hours even if the lumbar puncture is delayed.45  ● Management of elevated intracranial pressure: it includes procedures like the specific position of the head at 30°, CSF drainage (suggested in certain situations), osmotic dehydration by using 0.25-0.5 g/kg of mannitol (advised in cases of edema or brain masses). Mass removal or decompression may also be necessary, for example in case of a very big brain abscess. Also hypothermia and hyperventilation can be employed to treat ICU46 patients with elevated intracranial pressure.  43 From the slides. 44 Not all the viruses, but the majority of them. 45 Recall the study reported in Fig.9, which suggested that within 2 hours all patients were started on antibiotic treatment. 46 ICU: intensive care unit

Fluids may be lost due to sweating in case of fever, tachypnea in case of sepsis, or simply because patients do not eat or hydrate properly. The balance of volemia is important in critical care patients with severe CNS infections.   ANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENT – BACTERIAL MENINGITIS Professor says he usually does not ask this at the exam.  ● Ceftriaxone [2g x 2/day]: The standard treatment for bacterial meningitis is Ceftriaxone at double dose because it has to cross the BBB.47 ● Vancomycin [15-20 mg/Kg x 2/day]: if in the last 6 months the patient has had a recent trip to a country or has been living in a country with penicillin-Resistant-pneumococci, vancomycin is suggested as an additional agent (so, ceftriaxone plus vancomycin).  ● Ampicillin (amoxicillin) [2g x 6/day]: in newborns, patients above the age of 60 and immunocompromised subjects (including diabetics and alcohol abusers), the addition of ampicillin or amoxicillin is suggested in case of Listeria and mostly when the CSF appears clear.  ● Chloramphenicol [25 mg/Kg x 4/day]: in case of a history of severe allergies or anaphylaxis to penicillin and cephalosporins, chloramphenicol may be used instead with or without the addition of Cotrimoxazole [2.5-5 mg/kg x 4/day].    Fig.35 shows in red the countries that are suggested to have a significant prevalence (> 5%) of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Italy48 is one of these nations49. This means that in these areas, in order to protect the patient against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, vancomycin should be administered in addition to ceftriaxone in most of the cases. Then, after the results of the culture and the antibiogram are out, ceftriaxone may be given by itself, without a second antibiotic.   The duration of the antibiotic treatment is indicated as follows: ● S. pneumoniae: treatment should last 10-14 days (14 days if there is a slow recovery or the if the culture reveals a penicillin-resistant strain) ● Neisseria meningitidis: British guidelines suggest 5 days, whereas in Italy treatment usually last 5 to 7 days ● Listeria monocytogenes: the therapy is longer, around 21 days (3 weeks) ● Other bacteria: the duration ranges from 10 days to 3 weeks according to clinical conditions.  47 From the slides: Cefotaxime (2g x 4/day) may also be used 48 “We will see in our discussion that Italy is always red on the maps, so it’s bad” cit. 49 From the slides: The other countries are Canada, China, Croatia, Greece, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Spain, Turkay, and USA.

In Fig.37, the CPR (CSF to plasma ratio) of the drugs is shown, both in normal conditions (3rd column) or in case of inflamed meninges (4th column), so in the first days of treatment. Most drugs reach very low concentrations (2-5%) with just a few exceptions. Most of the medications reported can be safely used and in some cases the dose may be increased. For instance, Linezolid is one of the oxazolidinone antibiotics used for treating resistant gram-positive infections and it can also be employed effectively against various CNS infections thanks to its good pharmacokinetics in the CSF. 
 Fig. 37 In some cases, an intraventricular antibiotic therapy may be employed. It is usually performed in neurosurgery wards after a neurosurgical intervention. In fact, it can be difficult to treat ventriculitis (i.e. infection of the ventriculi) with normal antibiotics, so in some cases the antibiotics are instead directly injected inside the ventricles for a few days in order to increase the amount of drugs reaching the target and to reduce the bacterial load. Afterwards, systemic therapy is continued.   Risk factors for a fatal outcome in meningococcal disease50 There are some risk factors that should be considered when dealing with a patient with meningococcal disease are:51  50 From Wikipedia: Meningococcal disease describes infections caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (also termed meningococcus). 51 In bold are the most important ones.

This includes family members, doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc. All these people should therefore be treated prophylactically with Ciprofloxacin or Rifampicin.   -   Haemophilus influenzae: despite being uncommon, it is also easily transmissible by close contact, therefore it’s suggested to receive prophylaxis with Rifampicin because of the high degree of colonization and chance of infection.   It is very important to isolate the patient with active meningitis.  
  CORTICOSTEROIDS A review from the Cochrane library54 reports the updated version of “Corticosteroids for acute bacterial meningitis”. The professor highlighted three sentences in purple and one in yellow (here reported), which  52 From the slides. 53 This is what the professor says, although to me it seems incorrect since many other bacteria causing meningitis have person-to-person transmission, such as S. pneumoniae (from Wikipedia: It spreads by direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by autoinoculation). Maybe he meant that Neisseria meningitidis is the only bacterium responsible for meningococcal meningitis and it is spread from person-to-person, or that the bacterium only infects humans since there is no animal reservoir. 54 “Cochrane reviews are a bit boring to read, I think everyone - well, epidemiologists - just read the main results” cit.

However, they caused lower rates of severe hearing loss, any hearing loss, and neurological sequelae”. 2. “Corticosteroids reduced mortality in Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis” 3. “Corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss in children with H. Influenzae meningitis, but not in children with meningitis due to non-Haemophilus species” 4. “In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss, any hearing loss and short-term neurological sequelae. There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries” There is evidence suggesting that in children the use of corticosteroids was associated with lower rates of severe hearing loss and neurological sequelae, mainly in cases of Haemophilus influenzae infection. Corticosteroids also reduce mortality in Streptococcus Pneumoniae meningitis and, despite the differences between high- and low-income countries, globally the suggestion is to use short-term corticosteroids for the first days of bacterial meningitis. It is important to administer these drugs as soon as possible, therefore right before giving antibiotics or together with antibiotics.   TREATMENT FOR ENTEROVIRUSES While most cases of aseptic meningitis are mild and last for just a few days with no sequelae, there are also some severe forms in immunocompromised patients and newborns which might benefit from treatment. One of the potential drugs that may be used in these settings is Pleconaril, but it is still under development (phase 3), so it is not available on the market yet.    MOLLARET’S MENINGITIS Mollaret’s meningitis is a syndrome that may be diagnosed simply by listening to the patient’s medical history56. It’s characterized by: -  Repeated episodes of meningitis, typically lasting 2-5 days, occurring weeks to years apart; -  Usually mild symptoms, including headache and photophobia; it may also be associated with disorientation and dizziness; -  Almost 50% of patients over time develop long-term neurological impairment, such as problems with memory, balance, coordination and/or hearing; -  25% of cases are caused by HSV-2 (but also HSV-1 and EBV have been detected in some cases), even in patients without a history of recurrent genital herpes; -  Treatment of acute episodes with acyclovir or valacyclovir, and, potentially, prophylaxis with valacyclovir (1000 mg/day).  Prophylaxis with valacyclovir is effective. The professor followed 2 patients who displayed a decreased number of episodes (only one over 2 years instead of one every 6 months) during the prophylaxis. Therefore, it may provide some benefits although there are no randomized clinical trials to actually support this hypothesis.    CHRONIC MENINGITIS Chronic meningitis is characterized by an indolent onset, a duration > 4 weeks and signs of inflammation in the CSF. Differently from recurrent aseptic meningitis (Mollaret’s syndrome), it does not present with several  55 The complete results are reported on slide 72. 56 Once a patient stopped the professor on the stairs and started telling him his medical history, and after roughly 5 minutes the professor was able to tell him that he had Mollaret's syndrome. 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7

It is also different from sequelae.57 In order to make a diagnosis, it is necessary to obtain an accurate history (travel, exposure to animals or foods), perform a neurological examination (which is usually abnormal), carry on with further tests according to the hypothesis and examination, such as skin biopsy, lymph nodes, eye examination, etc., and ask for a brain contrast-enhanced MRI. Sometimes even a brain biopsy has to be employed, giving an idea of how difficult it is to reach the diagnosis.  Fig.39 reports the infectious and non-infectious causes of chronic meningitis. One of them is chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in patients with agammaglobulinemia, a chronic viral meningoencephalitis by enteroviruses. Another possible cause is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, an autoimmune disease associated with choroiditis, chronic iridocyclitis, and alopecia. Some of these conditions are very rare, so a complete workout with the neurologist is necessary to get the diagnosis. [From the slides: In persons who are agammaglobulinemic, a chronic enteroviral meningitis or meningoencephalitis may develop and last several years, often with a fatal outcome; this syndrome has been designated chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in agammaglobulinemia (CEMA) CEMA is a constellation of neurologic symptoms that include headache, seizures, hearing loss, lethargy/coma, weakness, ataxia, paresthesias, and loss of cognitive skills. In about half of these patients, a rheumatologic syndrome, usually dermatomyositis, also develops, probably as a direct result of enteroviral invasion of affected tissues. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is presumably an autoimmune disease consisting of bilateral eye disease, chronic meningitis, and, later in the course, skin findings. Ocular findings are diffuse choroiditis or chronic iridocyclitis. CNS findings include headache, nausea, neck stiffness, tinnitus, and CSF pleocytosis. Alopecia, vitiligo, or poliosis occur later in the disease.]   57 From the slides.

EPIDEMIOLOGY Encephalitis displays a low incidence, but the value can change a lot depending on the location, ranging from 2 to 7 cases/100,000 people/year59. It tends to be more common in children < 1 year old (13.7/100,000) and in elderly > 65 years old (10.6/100,000)60, and the incidence might be higher in certain epidemiological areas (e.g. Japanese Encephalitis61 in China and bordering countries).   IMPACT OF ENCEPHALITIS  The impact of encephalitis is relevant due to 3 particular features: ● Prolonged hospitalization: patients with encephalitis are hospitalized for a very long time and usually require admission to a post-acute rehabilitation setting; ● Mortality: 7-18% (not negligible); ● Disability: this is the most relevant problem, as it may reach up to 56% in certain cases. This means that roughly 10% of patients die, and out of the 90% who survive, more than half have a disability. So, the disability-free life expectancy is quite low.62  PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO ENCEPHALITIS The diagnosis is based on the presence of fever and signs or symptoms of CNS disease. However, it is important to make the differential diagnosis between the following conditions: -   infectious causes: encephalitis/meningitis and focal suppurative infections, such as brain abscesses and subdural empyema  -     ADEM63  -     Autoimmune encephalitis (encephalitis with no infectious cause) -     Encephalopathy    As can be seen in Fig.40, the diagnostic pathway starts with the triad of headache, nuchal rigidity and fever. If an altered mental status is also present, encephalitis, ADEM, encephalopathy, mass or abscesses should be suspected. Otherwise, meningitis may be considered, as patients with meningitis usually have a normal mental status. After this subdivision, the flow chart suggests a blood culture and to start empiric antibiotic therapy, followed by an MRI (or CT scan if MRI is not available) as soon as possible. Then, it is necessary to  58 This is a very broad definition. We will discuss a more pragmatic definition that be more helpful in the diagnosis. 59 These 2 values are the incidences in Finland and US respectively 60 The values in brackets refer to data from the US. 61 Japanese Encephalitis will be discussed in the future lessons. 62 The professor probably means that the YDLs (years lived with disability) is quite high, not that the life expectancy in patients without disability is low. As explained by prof. Massazza during the lesson on rehabilitation, “Years lived with disability (YLDs) are a measurement of the burden of disease. YLDs are calculated by multiplying the prevalence of a disorder by the short or long-term loss of health associated with that disability.” 63 ADEM: Acute demyelinating (or disseminated) encephalomyelitis 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7

Differential diagnosis with encephalopathy Encephalopathy is defined as a diffuse cerebral dysfunction without associated inflammation. It may be due to toxins (e.g. alcohol, licit or illicit drugs) or metabolic dysfunction (e.g. hypoxia, hypo- or hyperglycemia64, electrolyte disorders65, renal or hepatic failure66, etc.).  For example, patients with severe hypoglycemia arrive to the hospital in a state of coma. This can be quite frequent in tropical countries, especially in children, and it may be due to malaria, malnutrition, diarrhea or the combination of 2-3 of these factors. One of the first things that should be done is measuring the glycemia, because it may be corrected, even if slowly.  Regarding the clinical features, fever, headache, seizures and focal neurological signs are not common in encephalopathy, while they are frequently observed in encephalitis.    64 Hyperglycemia may cause hyperosmolar coma. 65 e.g. hypernatremia 66 renal or hepatic failure in very severe cases may present with diffuse cerebral dysfunction but without the inflammation.

ADEM is an acute demyelinating inflammatory disease of the CNS which usually appears with a delay of 1-4 weeks after an infection or vaccination. It is recognized in only half of the cases (50-60%). On the MRI, it is usually possible to appreciate diffused multicentric lesions in the white matter, which appear hyperintense on T2/FLAIR sequence (see figure on the right). In this type of images, the CSF appears black, so it can be differentiated from edema.  
The table above helps to differentiate between the clinical and laboratory findings of ADEM and of viral encephalitis. ADEM is common in young adults with recent vaccination and prodromal illnesses. There might be visual loss, usually without fever or with late-onset fever, which is instead common in viral encephalitis. There is usually no leukocytosis in ADEM. It is also possible to notice slight differences in MRI findings, such as white matter involvement in ADEM and grey matter in encephalitis (in both hemispheres). Furthermore, ADEM is usually gadolinium-negative. The CSF is similar in the two cases, so it’s not helpful. PCR instead can be used to make a correct diagnosis for viral encephalitis. If a brain biopsy is performed, different patterns of inflammation are observed: in ADEM there is mainly perivenular lymphocytic inflammation, while viral encephalitis presents perivascular inflammation mostly in the gray matter associated with neuronal and glial cell death, edema and viral inclusion bodies which suggest a viral etiology.   APPROACH TO ENCEPHALITIS - Quick diagnosis is important; some studies suggest that the delayed diagnosis of herpes encephalitis is associated with worse outcomes. -  MRI (if available) is better than CT scan (not so precise in defining the brain parenchyma) and should always be performed in patients above the age of 60, immunocompromised subjects, patients with other known CNS diseases67, seizures, focal neurological deficits68, or with signs and symptoms of raised ICP. -  CSF analysis: not only for all the normal paraments but also for viral PCR.  67 in order to understand if the clinical presentation is due to the previous disease or to a new problem. 68 in order to understand the cause behind the deficit, whether it’s due to a mass or to an inflammation of a specific area.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF ENCEPHALITIS Usually patients present a triad of fever, headache and altered mental status (this latter can be up or down, i.e. + or -, so patients can be psychotic or in coma). However, it is highly variable. Focal signs may also develop depending on the affected area: -      Hemiparesis -      Aphasia -      Ataxia -      Cranial nerve palsies -      Myoclonus (irregular and involuntary twitching of a muscle) -      Seizures -      Hypothermia (common in elderly) and loss of vasomotor control (autonomic dysfunction) -      Diabetes insipidus or SIADH may occur due to hypothalamic dysfunction    Fig.41 shows some clinical features that may help to recognize the correct pathogen. ● Parkinsonism, which includes bradykinesia69, rigidity and non-intentional tremors, is typical of West Nile Encephalitis ● Frontotemporal signs like aphasia, memory impairment and personality changes, are common in Herpes Viruses (mostly HSV 1 and HSV 6 and some forms of autoimmune encephalitis) ● Seizures are common in Herpes Viruses ● Brainstem signs like ataxia, ocular dysfunction, bulbar dysfunction (e.g. breathing and cardiovascular dysfunction), limb weakness, are typical of Bickerstaff encephalitis, which can be caused by Listeria, HSV, WNV, Enterovirus 71, Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE) ● Involvement of the anterior horn of the spinal cord presents with acute flaccid paralysis and it’s typical of Poliovirus but it is observed also in TBE and WNV.               OPERATIVE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA70 Altered mental status (decreased or altered level of consciousness, lethargy or personality changes) lasting for more than 24 hours, accompanied by at least 3 of the following associated manifestations: -      Fever >38°C within 72 hours before or after presentation; -      Generalized or partial seizures;  69 Bradykinesia: patients move very slowly 70 These criteria are used in studies.

Thus, at least 3 of these conditions plus altered mental status suggest the presence of encephalitis. Notice that fever may not always be present, and altered mental status may occur without all these associated signs.  Fig.45 shows several ways of entry of pathogens into the brain, already mentioned when talking about meningitis. -  (a) depicts retrograde axonal transport, which is usually employed by Herpesviruses, in particular HSV1 and HSV2, and VZV. These viruses can reactivate either in the skin or in the brain by following the axon retrogradely. For this reason, usually there are no skin lesions in patients with Herpes encephalitis and Varicella encephalitis, unless they are immunocompromised. In this case, there may be a subsequent viremia, although uncommon during reactivation. -  (b) depicts the BBB crossing, which may occur by crossing the endothelial cells either directly or indirectly (inside WBCs). It is usually observed in viral infections that give rise to viremia, such as WNV, VZV during varicella and measles virus, which is able to cross directly the BBB and enter the brain parenchyma. -  (c) shows the olfactory neurons, which represent a direct link to the external environment. This way of entrance is exploited by HSV and influenza viruses, which are able to cross the ethmoidal lamina cribrosa and enter the frontal lobes of the brain. -    (d) some pathogens are able to cross the blood-CSF barrier. CMV, for instance, has a tropism for endothelial and ependymal cells, thus it is able to cross them and enter the CSF. -   (e) Enteroviruses and mumps virus can enter directly into the CSF through the choroid plexus.   DIAGNOSIS  At least 3 sets of exams may be helpful in reaching the diagnosis: 1. MRI (brain imaging): it shows an increased signal on T2 and FLAIR sequences (diffusion-weighted more sensitive)71 and it might be more specific in some cases:  -     temporal lobe (frontal) and limbic system are typically involved in HSV and HHV-6  71 From the slides.

CSF analysis  3. EEG73: not compulsory but might help in certain cases.  
 Fig. 46 Fig.46 depicts a MRI in HSV-E infection. These records belong to a 60-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, who was brought by her family to the emergency unit since she started presenting an altered mental status and lethargy. As visible in both T2 and FLAIR sequences, there is a hyperintense zone in the right temporal and frontal hemispheres. There is also some Gadolinium enhancement which suggests inflammation mostly in the gray matter of the temporal lobe.   CSF analysis is helpful because it shows pleocytosis74 (consisting mainly of lymphocytes, 50-500/mm3), normal glucose levels and slightly elevated protein concentration. In some cases, like in WNV infection, there might be a predominance of neutrophils. Remember also that the absence of WBCs does not exclude encephalitis, since <5% of patients have <5 CSF WBCs. Viral PCR is highly sensitive (>95%), however it’s better to perform a lumbar puncture as soon as possible because after treatment with acyclovir, the viral load decreases, and so the PCR sensitivity declines.  From the slides: Viral PCR highly effective (>95%) ● HSV PCR declines with treatment ● HSV PCR+ at 4-7 days (and neg early, rare) ● CFS IgM for VZV and for WNV (PCR less sensitive)  Fig.4775 shown below reports the several etiologies behind encephalitis cases. There are substantial differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.  ● HIV-negative patients: viral and bacterial infections account for almost half of the cases, followed by Lyme disease, fungi, Syphilis, Mycobacteria, Prions disease and Pneumocystis76. However, in almost 40% of cases the etiology is unknown, so there no diagnosis.  72 From the slides. 73 EEG: electroencephalogram 74 Pleocytosis: increase in white cells count 75 Most of the data reported come from the US. 76 The professor has never seen a case encephalitis due to pneumocystis in his whole life.

 A study performed by the California Encephalitis Project in 2003 and 2009 on immunocompetent hospitalized patients, reported a large amount of cases with unknown etiology (84%), although viral infection was still the most predominant cause, including HSV, WNV, EBV, CMV, VZV and Enteroviruses.  The patients were selected based on the operative diagnostic criteria78: presence of an altered consciousness/mental status for >24 hours and at least one79 of the following: fever, seizures, focal neurologic findings, CSF pleocytosis, consistent EEG or neuroimaging.  In females, below the age of 30, they had more autoimmune encephalitis than viral encephalitis. The therapy is very different between viral and autoimmune encephalitis. For viral we use antivirals while for autoimmune we use corticosteroids.  NGS AND METAGENOMICS At the moment the medical field is trying to implement the use of Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) and metagenomics in clinical practice.80 It would allow not to use target PCR but directly DNA extraction, fragmentation and sequencing. It could be very useful for DNA viruses, while it’s a little more complicated for RNA viruses. It would define the taxonomic profiling of everything present in the CSF of patients with  77 Toxoplasma, a parasite, accounts for up to 11% 78 These are common criteria. 79 This is what is written on slide 86, but it may be a mistake in my opinion, since it was previously said that the operative diagnostic criteria required at least 3 (not one) associated manifestations. In the recording the professor does not specify the number and just says: “altered consciousness >24h plus at least fever, seizures, focal neurologic findings, CSF pleocytosis, consistent EEG or neuroimaging.” 80 but there is no funding.

On slide 101 the professor uploaded two papers81 which may be interesting to read to get an idea of the case study. In these studies, NGS was employed in patients with encephalitis and chronic meningitis, and the pathogens found in the CSF are shown in the colored column (“Pathogens Identified”) of Fig.49. While some are not surprising, such as HSV1 and Measles virus, others are really unexpected, such as astrovirus, arenaviruses and some cycloviruses, but it is unknown whether they are pathogenic or not. In fact, lots of viral genetic material can be identified through NGS, but it is not understandable whether these viruses represent the etiology of the disease. In any case it would be very interesting to use this technique in patients with no recognised causative agent. One of the most recent case studies which took place in a tertiary hospital in the US, reported that unknown etiology accounted for 30% of patients, viral etiology was predominant (48%), including HSV and VZV as usual, while autoimmune causes covered 22% of encephalitis cases. This means that a quarter of cases are

California Encephalitis Project explained before).    Therefore, it is very important to know what autoimmune encephalitis is, how to diagnose it and how it can be treated (N.B. treatment for autoimmune is opposite to that for antiviral encephalitis).   Autoimmune encephalitis refers to group of recently discovered diseases characterized by: ● an autoimmune process with clinical symptoms affecting behaviour and cognition;  ● potentially reversible after immune-suppressive therapy or by removing the “antigenic source” (this latter is typical of paraneoplastic encephalitis);  ● characterized by specific autoantibodies,  ● it is important to distinguish between the two main forms: paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic. In the former, the source for the primary source is relevant since its removal will allow people to improve. In the table are listed different types of AIE divided by autoantibodies and their targets (intracellular antigens, synaptic receptors, ion channels and other cell-surface proteins).  Remember that in some cases the diagnosis of AIE may anticipate the diagnosis of cancer by many years (maximum is 8 years). Therefore, follow-up of the patient is very important.  An example the professor gave was that of a teratoma, which was clinically and radiologically evident 8 years after the first diagnosis of AIE.   Diagnosis The existing criteria for AIE are pretty complicated and is explained in the flowchart of fig.5482. The significant aspect to keep in mind is that clinical facts and evidence suggest that an early immuno-therapy improves the outcome. Therefore, the diagnosis of AIE should be as quick as possible. So, when a young patient comes to your attention with encephalitis, the first step is sampling a CSF (store some of it) and performing a viral PCR. If this turns out to be negative, the second step is to do an  82 The professor says to go through the flowchart to have an idea, but he didn’t explain it. He says he doesn’t want us to remember the single criteria.

Anti- NMDA receptor encephalitis Even if the specific diagnostic criteria for autoimmune encephalitis are not to be remembered, we should have an idea of what they are.  Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is the most common among AIE (fig.52) and it mainly affects young women, with a variety of symptoms that include those listed in fig.55.  
 Fig. 55 depicts the largest case (study, ed) published in Lancet Neurology in 2013. As it can be seen, behaviour and cognition disorders are present in almost all cases (nearly 100%). In addition, memory deficit, speech disorders, seizures and movement disorders are common and present in the vast majority of cases. In some rarer cases there can be loss of consciousness, autonomic symptoms or central hypoventilation83. Cerebellar  83 more common in adults.

This is just to give you the spectrum of clinical manifestations.  For what concerns treatment85, we can see from fig.5 that there is an important difference in relapse rate when the patients undergo no treatment (25% risk of relapse) or are treated by immune-suppression with specific drugs (around 10% risk of relapse at 24 months).  So, in the end, you should immune-suppress them. The first line treatments include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), or plasmapheresis. While the second line immunotherapy treatments include rituximab and cyclophosphamide.  2. Hashimoto’s encephalopathy   This is a much more uncommon form of AIE, which is related to some extent to the presence of thyroid peroxidase and/or to thyroglobulin antibodies (but mostly anti-TPO) that can be detected both in the serum and in the CSF of the patient, even in patients with no previous thyroid pathology.   AIE AFTER HSVE   
 Fig.6 shows the most important paper published two years ago in Lancet Neurology. It was the description of a case series of neurological relapses or worsening of deficits in patients with HSV encephalitis, that in the whole literature have been described in up to ¼ of cases.  They tend to occur within the first 2 months of completing treatment with acyclovir.  In some patients, the symptoms of relapse are caused by reactivation or persistence of the herpes simplex virus, as shown by detection of viral DNA in CSF, but in other cases there is no effect of acyclovir.   The cohort study is a bit complicated, but briefly: some patients who were affected by HSV encephalitis later  84 more common in children. 85 not required to know in detail.

Then it’s required to follow up the patients for an extended time and to check for new symptoms, whilst also actively looking for anti-NMDAR antibodies early on (prognostic feature).  Bear in mind that several viral infections (including viral Hepatitis) might lead to the exposure of antigens causing the production of autoantibodies in predisposed individuals, thus leading onset of an autoimmune disease. For example, it has been shown that acute hepatitis, even those caused by minor viruses, may be the trigger for developing AIE over time.       SYMPTOMS The main symptom, especially in young children, is choreoathetosis, which namely is involuntary movements mostly in hands, a combination of chorea86 and athetosis87.88 (fig.58) 
 In fig. 59, the different symptoms that occur are divided according to age of affected individual. As it can be seen, patients older than 4 y.o. present mostly psychiatric symptoms.   DIAGNOSIS The third diagnostic clue used in encephalitis diagnosis is Electroencephalogram (EEG).89 It is used for two reasons. One is because we want to see if there are some focal signs associated, but also because you can see a diffused slowing.  It shows generalized slowing (suggesting that whole brain parenchyma is affected) or focal abnormalities (sharp or spike activity, epileptiform discharges mostly in patients with seizures, but also in those without, being a negative prognostic feature). Depending on where these abnormalities are found, we can orientate ourselves toward different diagnoses since there is a typical lobe involvement.  • If the temporal lobes are affected in 75-80% of cases it will be an HSVE; • In case of anterior predominant slowing, it is most likely a West Nile Virus Encephalitis.   86 irregular migrating contractions 87 twisting and writhing  88 at this link on the slides you can see an example of choreoathetosis https://youtu.be/PDcr3PJlrBI  89 the first two being MRI and CSF analysis are explained before.

On slide 125 and 126  there is a list of minor viruses involved in the aetiology that the professor put for completion but that due to their complexity are not be covered nor asked.   DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Differential diagnosis among several pathogens or other causes is quite complex. Some of these etiologies will be discussed in the ADE such as Rhabdovirus, Helminths, Ameba… Bear in mind that vascular abnormalities might give symptoms similar to those of encephalitis. Some drugs may cause it e.g. CAR T-cell therapy; prions, etc.  - Culture-negative (Mycoplasma, Listeria, Ricketsia, Leptospira, Bartonella, Cryptococcus, Mucor, TB, Toxoplasma);  - Ameba e Negleria fowleri (PAM); Acanthamoeba/Balamutia chronic encephalitis (with granuloma) - Helminths (Strongyloides, Baylisascaris procyonis – raccoon, Toxocara)  - Rhabdovirus - Neoplasia - Vascular abnormalities - Abscess and empyema - Reye’s syndrome - Intoxication  - ADEM – Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis - Prions HERPES SIMPLEX ENCEPHALITIS (HSV-E) ● It’s the commonest cause of sporadic encephalitis (1:250K pop/year), accounting for 10% of encephalitis cases around the world. ● It has a bimodal presentation, with ⅓ of patients aged <20 years old and presenting probably a primary infection, in which instead of causing gingivostomatitis the virus reaches the brain causing encephalitis; and ⅔ of subjects who are >50 years old and present a reactivation, in which the virus doesn’t follow the normal route of skin involvement.  ● After the primary infection, there is a latency in the trigeminal sensory ganglion, after which the virus may reactivate, rarely through the tentorial nerves (cerebral fossa) or olfactory nerve.  ● At autopsies, patients with HSV encephalitis display a very high viral load in the CNS (olfactory bulb, hippocampus and brainstem). 
 Fig.60 shows the typical symptomatology of HSVE. The most common manifestations are fever and altered consciousness, while headache, disorientation, seizures, personality changes, memory disturbances, etc. are less frequent.

As regards the treatment, there is a significant delay in the administration of acyclovir with respect to the presentation of symptoms (literature estimates 2-5 days). For this reason, the professor suggests, if the CSF is clear, to start directly with acyclovir (with an additional antibiotic) even before the results of the viral PCR are ready, as the treatment must be initiated as soon as possible. Then, if the PCR turns out to be negative, the drug may be withdrawn. Acyclovir is taken in doses of 10 mg/Kg every 8 hours for 14-21 days [depending on the results of diagnostic tests]90. The prognosis depends on:  - Age: mortality is low in children (11% if <2 y.o.), intermediate in adults (22% if 22-59 y.o.), and very high in the elderly (62% if >60 y.o.) - Level of consciousness, according to the Glasgow Coma Scale - Immune suppression - Duration of symptoms before the start of acyclovir  HHV-6  HHV-6 has been studied only recently before it was the cause of exanthem subitum (roseola) in children. However, a growing number of studies suggested that it could play a role in a lot of diseases so we don’t know yet what its pathogenic role might be. 
Fig.61 shown a biopsy proving a lethal HHV-6 encephalitis after cord blood transplant.  In immunocompromised patients its role is established, while in immunocompetent subjects it is still debated. However, if you detect HHV-6 and cannot find any other cause, we suggest treating it with ganciclovir, rather than with aciclovir that is ineffective. - Two subgroups: HHV-6A and HHV-6B, that infect nearly all human beings (<2 yy). - Infancy is often symptomatic, resulting in childhood fever, diarrhea, and exanthem subitum rash (commonly known as roseola). Although rare, this initial infection can also cause febrile seizures, encephalitis or intractable seizures. - It has a life-long latency and can become reactivated later in life (transplant recipients).    90 From the slides.

An NINDS study found HHV-6 DNA in the CSF of 40% of 35 immunocompetent patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology (Yao 2009) HHV-6 encephalitis/encephalopathy associated with primary infection in infants has an unexpectedly poor outcome. In a nationwide survey in Japan, 46.9% of 81 cases resulted in neurological sequelae or death (Yoshikawa 2009) One study found that out of 983 cases of acute encephalopathy in Japan, 17% were caused by HHV-6.  64% of the severe cases with biphasic seizures in this study were attributed to HHV-6, only half of which survived without permanent neurological sequelae (Hoshino 2011)91  WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV)  Actually, it has nothing to do with the Nile, but origins from Uganda and it was discovered in the 30s. West Nile virus is a single-stranded RNA flavivirus, with different lineages92. It may infect several hosts including humans, birds, mosquitos, horses and other mammals. Hosts can be divided into amplifying hosts (including birds, which are does in which the virus can amplify), vectors and incidental hosts.  Vectors are mainly mosquitoes of many species mainly Culex spp. and Aedes spp., in addition the virus can also be transmitted by ticks in Asia and Russia. Humans, birds and other animals are incidental hosts. We talk about WNV because it is a growing epidemic and recently we have had many cases in Europe.  Fig.63 shows the latest available map of the US where there was an epidemic. They had cases since 1999 and reported 15,000 cases of neuroinvasive WNV with a mortality of approximately 4%. It is mostly localized in the center of the US and southern regions, due to the higher presence of vectors.

Fig. 64 shows the incidence of WNV in Europe. At the end of the ‘90s, there were few cases in Eastern Italy but there has been a major spread in the East of Europe but also in Western Italy such as in Piedmont, in the South of France and in the center of Italy. In 2019, there were 463 cases in Europe (almost half of the cases in Italy, more specifically in the north-west region, like Piedmont) and 50 deaths. Case fatality was around 7-10% (73 deaths out of 1000). Last year there were many cases in Lazio and Sardinia.   CLINICAL PRESENTATION IN HUMANS There is a short incubation (2 to 14 day) and most of patients, like in flaviviridae infections, are asymptomatic (80%). This means that if we report a thousand cases of encephalitis, we will have 100,000 cases of asymptomatic West Nile, so the numbers will probably be huge and that is why we try to control the virus.  West Nile fever is present in 10-15% of cases in the most common form resembling influenza. Most infections resolve in 2-6 days. A minority of patient may present persistent fatigue.  West Nile Neuroinvasive disease is quite uncommon (approximately 1% of patients), even though a bit more common in those aged above 60. A paper93 suggests that one of the key receptors for WNV is CCR594 that is a co-receptor for HIV. It seems that patients with a CCR5 deficiency are at higher risk of having a neuroinvasive infection, therefore there might be some genetic involvement. Neuroinvasive disease can be severe and life-threatening. There are three syndromes: o Encephalitis (50-60%): tremors due to involvement of the basal ganglia (Parkinson-like presentation); o Meningitis (30-40%); o Acute flaccid paralysis (10%), like polio Half of the patients will have chronic neurological sequelae and the disease will be irreversible. [Persistent neurological dysfunction may occur (40-50% of cases)]  The problem is that we either control the vector or we do not know what to do, as it does not exist a vaccine to prevent West Nile.

The symptoms are very different: no headache, no CNS presentations.   Transverse Myelitis: -  rare, acquired diseases;  -  characterized by a rapid onset of: ●  Weakness ●  Sensory alterations ●  Bowel or bladder dysfunction (according to the level) - Some autoimmune disorders are associated and include Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Multiple Sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica (that involves several metamers and might also involve the optic nerve) and acute flaccid myelitis.  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA ● Sensory, motor or autonomic dysfunction attributable to the spinal cord; ● Bilateral, due to the transverse effect; ● Defined sensory level (cervical, thoracic, lower thoracic, lumbar plegia seen in fig.15); ● No evidence of compressive cord lesion; ● Inflammation that can be seen on MRI or in CSF as pleocytosis or elevated Ig index or gadolinium enhancement;   ● progression is fast, usually within 3 weeks but some sequelae may persist over time. Fig.65 shows the different outcomes depending on the location of the lesions, while fig. 65 and 66 show MRI images of a cervical thoracic longitudinal myelitis and a thoracic transverse myelitis respectively.  There is hyperintensity in the spinal cord that is in 1 or 2 metamers and the symptoms are actually related to the level where the inflammation is localized.

Weakness may be associated with respiratory impairment from diaphragm or intercostal muscle paralysis; ○ Herpes viruses HSV2 in adults or VZV with shingles and focal myelitis: acute onset of paralysis in the legs (less commonly the arms), reduced or absent reflexes, or paradox hyperreflexia with extensor-plantar responses, decreased sensation, and decreased anal tone or urinary incontinence with sacral dermatome involvement; ○ Enteroviruses might be a common cause ○ HIV ○ Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) ○ Zika virus ○ Neuroborreliosis (Lyme) ○ Mycoplasma ○ Treponema pallidum  OTHER CAUSES  ● Neurosarcoidosis  ● Paraneoplastic syndromes  ● Systemic inflammatory autoimmune disorders that might involve the spinal cord:    ○ Ankylosing spondylitis  ○ Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ○ Behcet disease ○ Mixed connective tissue disease ○ Rheumatoid arthritis ○ Scleroderma ○ Sjogren’s syndrome ○ Systemic lupus erythematosus95
