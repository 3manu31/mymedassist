Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         1  FUNGAL INFECTIONS  Before starting, I have included a set of brief cases.   The first patient has a history of AML, he received a stem cell transplant and chemotherapy. A few months later, the developed fever and these painful skin lesions (fig. 1). Which questions would you ask this patient?   One student suggested to ask the patient if he was taking immunosuppressors, the professor said that he was. Another student suggested that we should ask the patient if he was taking any new drugs that could’ve caused a reaction, and the professor said it is possible for drugs to give a reaction. Then, another student said we should ask the patient if he has travelled. The professor said this is important, especially if the patient has travelled to tropical countries.   Another student then asked if the patient has been recently hospitalized. The professor said no, but he said that the patient goes frequently to the outpatient hematology ward for check-ups.   Professor said that he would add the question of whether the patient has had contact with animals – domestic animals, wild animals, or any vectors (pigs, mosquitoes, flies) – and whether the patient has been swimming somewhere, kayaking, climbing, going in the woods, so any kind of contact with the outside.   Then the professor asked which test we would request. Someone said a culture of the lesions. In this case, more specifically, a skin biopsy should be requested.  The results showed fungal hyphae invading the blood vessels. These hyphae were described as being septated (walls between cells) with acute angle-branching, with some features being compatible with the fungus Aspergillus.   All bacterial and viral test results were negative. But a fungus few in the blood culture bottle and was visible upon Gram stain. The same fungus also grew from the tissue culture.   Based on phenotypic analysis, this organism was identified as a Fusarium species.  INTRODUCTION  Fungi are eukaryotic microorganisms. They are heterotrophic, which means that they digest their food externally by releasing hydrolytic enzymes into their immediate surroundings. This explains why fungi have the ability to invade blood vessels. There are often sources of hemorrhage on the lesions. And this is because they digest their surroundings.  They are essentially aerobic and can synthesize lysine L-α-adipic acid biosynthetic pathway. Fungi possess chitinous cell walls, plasma membranes containing ergosterol, 80S rRNA, and microtubules composed of tubulin.

Spores may be either asexual or sexual in origin. CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI – MORPHOLOGY Yeasts are single-celled forms that reproduce by budding.  Molds form multicellular hyphae.  Hyphae can be sparsely septate to regularly septate and possess a variable number of nuclei. In fig. 3 it can be observed how much bigger mold is compared to bacteria.    
  Dimorphic fungi grow as yeasts or spherules in vivo, as well as in vitro at 37°C, but as molds at 25°C. Dimorphism is regulated by factors such as temperature, CO2 concentration, pH, and the levels of cysteine or other sulfhydryl-containing compounds.

Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         3  CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS The classification of fungal infections depends on a few factors. The most important from the point of view of clinical presentation is the site of infection, which can be: superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous or systemic (deep). It can also be classified based on the route of acquisition: either exogenous (airborne, cutaneous, percutaneous) or endogenous (normal flora). For example: candida is present in our body in high amount in the GI tract. It is also present in the mouth, vagina, but in the GI tract it is present in the most significant amount. So, in a situation in which candida passes from the GI tract into the blood circulation, it can cause an infection, the so-called candidemia.  Lastly, it can be classified based on the virulence. Primary pathogens can establish infections in normal hosts, everyone can get an infection by these fungi, whereas opportunistic pathogens cause disease in immune-compromised hosts.  In fig. 5, it is possible to observe the classification of the non-invasive fungi.   
   And in fig. 6 the invasive pathogens are also included. The systemic ones can spread to locations other than the organs where they started.  The ones in bold are the ones that we have already talked about during the course.

It is more common in people after summer, once they have been exposed to sun. It is very easy to treat, we usually use topical antifungal agents.  
   DERMATOPHYTES The professor didn’t explain the different types of dermatophytes. He just read the names written on the images (fig. 8). Usually, topical treatment is enough to deal with these skin manifestations. 
   CANDIDIASIS OF THE SKIN – INTERTRIGO  Intertrigo is also very common, especially in hospitalized patients and diabetic patients. Very often it is caused by endogenous fungi, such as candida, which can cause these sub-mammary or inguinal lesions (fig. 9).

Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         5   MYCETOMA OR “MADURA FOOT”  This is a very specific one. Not very common in Italy, but it is common in certain tropical countries. It is usually acquired by walking barefoot in soil. We can observe the formation of chronic hypertrophic lesions on the foot, which gets very big. Although the disease usually affects the foot, any part of the body can also be affected. The treatment is a combination of surgery and antifungal drugs.   
fig. 10  ENDEMIC MYCOSIS There are fungal infections that are seen very specifically in certain areas of the world (fig. 11). There are no cases of these diseases in Europe, it is more common in parts of Africa, Asia and America. Out of these diseases, histoplasmosis is very important. Histoplasma is the main fungi affecting the African continent, as well as parts of South America and the United States. Remember that travel history of the patient is very important because it might indicate different fungi.

Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         6    HISTOPLASMOSIS  It is common in the Midwestern and Central United States, along the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.  Histoplasma capsulatum proliferates best in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings due to the content of nitrate and pH, which becomes the perfect environment for the fungus.  People who are infected are usually those in contact with chicken coops or farm buildings with large accumulations of bird droppings, abandoned buildings, bird roost sites, caves, and wood lots.  There is a list of activities that makes people more likely to get in contact with the fungus, such as: excavation, construction, demolition, remodeling, wood cutting and gathering, exploring caves, and cleaning structures that are encrusted with bird or bat guano.  HISTOPLASMOSIS – CLINICAL PRESENTATION  Most people are asymptomatic. And most of those with symptoms mostly present with pulmonary histoplasmosis because inhalation is the most common pathway entry. The biggest problem for us is the histoplasma lesions in radiology (fig. 14) is exactly the same as tuberculosis, so the clinical presentation is cough, fever, weight loss, etc. Sometimes we treat patients for tuberculosis and the patient doesn’t respond to treatment. So, we should think of histoplasma.

Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         7  I have seen a case in Uganda in which histoplasmosis presented with these skin lesions (fig. 15) and lung lesions on a young woman who had HIV. She was tested for TB, and in the end the culture of one of her lesions came back positive for histoplasma. She had both TB and histoplasma at the same time.   
  Let’s proceed by talking about fungi that we actually see in Europe.  ASPERGILLOSIS  Aspergillosis is an umbrella term that covers all illnesses due to due to allergy, airway or lung invasion, cutaneous infection or dissemination by species of Aspergillus.  Most of the cases, around 70% are caused by A. fumigatus, but it can also be caused by A. flavus, niger, terreus. Inhalation of conidia is common (lungs or sinuses) while tissue invasion is rare.  The important thing about Aspergillosis is that microbial factors are able to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis and T-cell response, then they proliferate, leading to vascular invasion and eventually to infarction and tissue necrosis. It is similar to tuberculosis, but weaker.  ASPERGILLOSIS – RISK FACTORS There are several risk factors. It is important to remember severe and prolonged neutropenia (neutropenia stages: from 1000 mcL to 500 mcL is mild; from 500 mcL to 200 mcL is moderate; from 200 mcL to 100 mcL is severe; below 100 mcL is extreme neutropenia). We often see this in hematological patients, in cancer patients as a reaction to chemotherapy.  Administration of high doses of corticosteroids is also a risk factor. Besides that, immunodepression is a risk factor, including chronic granulomatous disease, hematopoietic cell transplant, AIDS. And some drugs are also considered risk factors: ibrutinib and venetoclax.  But there are cases of aspergillosis without severe immunosuppression, just moderate or no immunosuppression at all, such as:  • In COPD patients → they have two risk factors: obstruction of the airways and the administration of corticosteroids, which is a treatment for COPD.  • ICU admission  • Viral infections (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV) → they impair the airways and contribute to the proliferation of Aspergillus  • High exposure (e.g. construction sites workers)

There is, in very immunosuppressed patients, CNS infections (ring enhancing lesions, cortical and subcortical infarction and dissemination from sinuses). Infarction is very important to be remembered because as mentioned before, Aspergillus cause vascular invasion which leads to infarction.   The professor didn’t mention everything written on the slides, so I attached a picture containing everything (fig. 16).  
 PULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS Most important form. I will show you a picture of an aspergilloma (fig. 17). There is a cavity, and some other radiological features are: single or multiple nodules, patchy or segmental consolidation and peribronchial infiltrates.

fig. 17 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 
Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         9  Some signs and symptoms of pulmonary aspergillosis are: fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and hemoptysis.  There is a form of Aspergillosis called Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA), mostly seen in patients with asthma, which is characterized by wheezing, dyspnea, worsening of asthma symptoms, productive cough with brown mucus or mucus plugs, hemoptysis, anorexia, fever and malaise.  It is usually diagnosed based on the IgE levels.  ASPERGILLOSIS – DIAGNOSIS  The definitive criteria of diagnosis are culture + the presence of hyphae in biopsies. But we might also start by doing a sputum and BAL staining and culture (GAM and/or PCR on BAL). Imaging examinations include X-ray and CT scan.  Another option are serum biomarkers (Galactomannan, 1,3-Beta-D-Glucan) and PCR.  ASPERGILLOSIS – TREATMENT  The professor said he didn’t want to go through treatment because it is too much.  According to the slides, the available treatments are: voriconazole (or posaconazole or isavuconazole when voriconazole is not tolerated) added to ecchinocandins in severe forms; amphotericin-B if azole-R >10% or DDIs/intolerance to azoles; and decrease immune-suppression if possible.  CANDIDA We have talked about candida in the lecture about STI, even though it is not an STI. We have talked about candida in the mouth, in the esophagus, etc.  The three major presentations are:  1. Local mucocutaneous infections 2. Disseminated infections in neutropenic hosts/ICU/AIDS patients 3. Invasive focal infections after candidemia or when abnormalities or devices are present (prosthetic heart valves, CNS shunts…) Today we are going to be focusing on candidemia, which is very common because candida is on the skin. Even immunocompetent hosts can develop candidemia.   Question: Is candidemia common because it is asymptomatic or is it common because it is present on the skin?  Answer: Usually, candidemia itself can be completely asymptomatic or you can have complications. Most often candida is found due to blood cultures.   In fig. 18 you can observe the six most clinically relevant Candida species. The most important is Candida albicans, which is the one that is related to infections. But currently a very important type of candida is Candida auris, endemic in Europe and it is very resistant.   L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 
Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         10      There are some regional differences (fig. 19). And those in red are reports of Candida auris in the world.  
  The local mucocutaneous types of candida infection are:  1. Oropharyngeal

fig. 19 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 
Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         11  2. Esophagitis 3. Vulvovaginitis  4. Balanitis 5. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis → common in children, which have repeated skin or nail infections, and it is common in the setting of autoimmune syndromes 6. Mastitis  INVASIVE CANDIDIASIS It always starts with candidemia. The one exception is peritonitis. But all the others (kidneys, lungs, liver) are usually related to candidemia.   Now the first line of treatment for candidemia is (I couldn’t understand what he said so I wrote what I found according to my research online) echinocandin, like caspofungin and anidulafungin.         INVASIVE CANDIDA INFECTIONS – RISK FACTORS 1. Over proliferation of Candida → in skin or mucosal flora, with documented culture-based colonization at multiple body sites, can be risk factors when the following medical interventions are performed:  o Broad-spectrum antibiotics use  o Long-term stay in an acute-care facility or ICU o Mechanical ventilation   2. Breaches in skin or mucosal barriers, either related to an underlying condition or iatrogenic: a. Extensive burns  b. Gastrointestinal perforation  c. Acute or necrotizing pancreatitis  d. Gastrointestinal surgery  e. Chemotherapy-induced mucositis  f. Indwelling intravascular catheters  g. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis  h. Total parenteral nutrition

Indwelling prosthetic materials, including left ventricular assist devices, ventriculo-peritoneal shunts or external ventricular drains  j. Intravenous drug use  k. Urinary tract instrumentation   3. Intrinsic or acquired immunosuppression a. Genetic susceptibility to invasive candidiasis by variations in immune-related genes  b. Extremes of age (in particular, small, vulnerable newborns)  c. Diabetes mellitus  d. Viral infections such as COVID-19  e. Profound and prolonged neutropenia  f. Solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients  g. Immunosuppressive treatment, including corticosteroids  h. Graft-versus-host disease  DIAGNOSIS OF CANDIDA INFECTIONS  Once again, he did not say anything about diagnosis during the lecture, so I added the image present on the slides.  
 CANDIDEMIA First of all, if candida is present in the blood culture, it is NEVER a contaminant. But if you see candida in the urine, mucus or in the sputum, it most likely a contaminant; therefore, we do not treat candiduria, for example. But if it’s in the blood it is an infection, a severe infection, which means it requires treatment and source control: • Caspo/anidulafungin for 2 weeks after first negative blood culture (repeated every day or every other day until negative) o In neutropenic patients, neutropenia also should be resolved for stopping antifungal therapy • Negative eye fundus examination (2-20%) and cardiac ultrasound → for source control • CVC removal (or individualized management in neutropenic patients) → also source control  Candidemia presents with minimal fever to full-blown sepsis. In case of invasive candidiasis, it may affect the eye, kidney, heart and CNS.

Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         13   Disseminated candidiasis might present skin manifestations, such as in fig.23.  
   ZYGOMYCOSIS (MUCORRMYCOSIS)  Then, just to finish I would like to spend one slide talking about mucormycosis (or zygomycoosis). It is caused by a family of fungi called Mucorales, and includes: Rhizopus, Cunninghamella, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Saksenea, and Absidia.  The hyphae are broad, it has 5-15 micon diameter, and it is irregularly branches with rare septations (fig 24).  The risk factors for this disease are:  • Diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis!) • Treatment with glucocorticoids • Hematologic malignancies • Hematopoietic cell transplantation • Malnutrition • Trauma/burns • Solid organ transplantation • Treatment with deferoxamine • Iron overload • Recent COVID-19 • AIDS • Injection drug use They are very important because they can cause a lot of damage: rhino-orbital cerebral (the most severe, from the sinus it spreads to the eyes and to the brain), pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, renal, isolated CNS, disseminated.  Fig. 25 shows the rhino-orbital cerebral condition, in which from the sinus it also spread down to the oral cavity. The treatment requires a combination of medical therapy and surgery to remove all of this tissue of fungal infection.   DIAGNOSIS We have already talked about it:  • Gram stain → fungi are Gram positive. • Histopathology o Superficial infection – acute, subacute or chronic dermatitis with folliculitis

 o Galactomannan is only in Asprgillus, it is a very specific test.  o 1, 3-β-D-Glucan (βDG) is common to all fungi, but Mucor (couldn’t understand clearly if this is what he said).   
fig. 26 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 
Beatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         15    Remember that some antibiotics are produced in fungal cultures, so there are pieces of fungi in certain antibiotics, such as beta-lactams. If the patient is taking such antibiotics, it could lead to false positive results for Galactomannan.   False positive results might also occur in βDG if the patient is in haemodialysis. TREATMENT The Professor finishes the lecture by showing a slide of antifungal drugs. He says he usually doesn’t ask for treatment in the exam, but I have added the table of antifungals (fig. 28) to the SBOBINA for the sake of completeness.   
  There are 3 types of fungi that are very important when we are talking about drug resistance: Candida auris, azole-rsistant Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton indotineae.
