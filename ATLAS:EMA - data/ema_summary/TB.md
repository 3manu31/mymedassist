- ## Primary (pulmonary) TB
    - epidemiology >>>
        - Global prevalence
        - High incidence in low-income countries
        - Incidence rates higher in specific populations (e.g., HIV-positive individuals)
        - Risk factors: immunocompromised, crowded living conditions
        - Transmission via airborne droplets
    - 3 big killers >>>
        - TB, HIV, Malaria - in children & immunodeficient 
    - etiology >>>
        - Mycobacterium TB complex: M.tuberculosis, africanum, Bovis (↑mortality, + assoc. w/ HIV)
        - cell wall - major virulence factor - resist environmental factors
        - ↑ replication ≠ slow cultures
    - pathology >>>
        - airborne transmission - infectious droplet nuclei - remain aerosolized for a few hours
        - extrapulmonary TB = not contagious
        - 90% expelled by ciliary system
        - most of remaining, phagocytized by macroph. ⇒ replicate ⇒ granuloma formation
        - granuloma
            - central zone; caseous necrosis
            - intermediate; macroph. & monocytes
            - external; giant multinucleated cells - barrier to Mycobactect. spread
        - DD granuloma biopsy (possible other diagnosis from granuloma biopsy):
            - NTM, sarcoidosis, fungal infections, lymphoma
    - symptoms >>>
        - chronic course - 10-20% asymptomatic
        - non-specific extrapulm. sympt: fever, fatigue, anorexia
        - chest symptoms: pleural/thoracic pain, productive cough, hemoptysis (late symptom)
        - primary progressive TB - lymph node enlargement ⇒ may involve into miliary form (disseminated) / CNS
    - diagnosis >>>
        - suspicion & clinical features
        - microbiological diagnosis:
            - staining - acid fast - quick, but when higher load/more contagious
            - PCR - quick, medium/high sensitivity - detects dead mycobacteria too
            - culture (gold standard) - high sensitivity, but slow (might need to treat before results)
            - lipoarabinomannan (LAM) - component of cell wall - detected in urine, highly sensitive, cheap
    - treatment >>>
        - isolation if suspect
        - standard therapy: 2 months isoniazid, rifampicin and other combo ⇒ then, 4 months only isoniazid & rifampicin
        - multiple drug regimen - to avoid resistance
- 
- 
- ## latent TB
    - epidemiology >>>
        - immunocompetent - mycobact. replicate in macroph.
        - 95% maintain immune control - 5% reactivates
    - pathology >>>
        - granuloma - calcification ⇒ scarring
    - symptoms >>>
        - silent, asymptomatic
        - not contagious
    - diagnosis >>>
        - Tuberculin skin test (TST) - Mantoux
            - after 72h, positive if bigger than 10mm
        - Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)
            - higher sensitivity but expensive
            - doesnt differentiate active VS latent TB, or other infections
    - treatment >>>
        - PET CT + biopsy ⇒ to predict reactivation risk (lung nodules)
        - categories for preventive therapy:
            - HIV+, recent exposure, organ transplant, immunosuppressed, ppl from high prevalence countries, lab personnel
        - 3 months of isoniazid + rifampicin
- 
- 
- ## Extra-pulmonary TB
    - extra-pulmonary TB - examples >>>
        - miliary/disseminated 
        - Lymphadenitis 
        - Serositis ‒ Pleuritis, Pericarditis 
        - CNS meningitis 
        - genitourinary 
    - 
    - miliary/disseminated >>>
        - metastatic lesions of mycobacteria
        - acute, rapidly evolving - fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia
        - Xray - nodular pattern in interstitium
        - negative sputum staining, BAL, Mantoux - so difficult diagnosis
        - PCR better for diagnosis
    - Lymphadenitis >>>
        - most common extrapulm. TB in children & immunosuppressed
        - commonly affect nodes: infraclavicular, lateral, cervical
        - non painful, soft lymph nodes
        - positive Mantoux, PCR
        - biopsy for better diagnosis
        - DD: NTM, lymphomas, metastatic tumors, toxoplasma
    - Serositis
        - Pleuritis >>>
            - pain pleural effusion
            - thoracentesis for diagnosis - lymphocytes found - not specific for TB though
            - negative/low sensitivity stvisaining, PCR, culture
        - Pericarditis >>>
            - subacute
            - fever, pain, tachycardia, ECG alterations
            - US: pericardial effusion
            - complications: cardiac tamponade
    - CNS (meningitis) >>>
        - altered CSF circulation ⇒ hydrocephalus ⇒ ventricles enlargement
        - slow onset: headache, fever, weight loss, cranial nerve palsies
        - sudden onset: vasculitis lesions
        - CTI/MRI - tuberculomas
        - CSF - ↓ GLUCOSE 
        - negative/low sensitivity to staining, PCR, culture
        - longer standard therapy
    - genitourinary >>>
        - urinary TB
            - 2nd most common extrapulm. TB
            - hematogenous spread ⇒ chronic pyelonephritis
            - sterile pyuria - ↑ leukocytes but negative culture
        - Genital TB
            - men: urethritis, superficial ulcer, chronic epididymitis
            - woman: strictures, infertility
- 
- 
- ## IRIS
    - IRIS >>>
        - immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome
        - paradoxical inflammation against a foreign antigen in patients who have started ART (co-infection w/ HIV)
    - RF >>>
        - bacterial load
        - dissemination besides lungs
    - pathology >>>
        - ARV treatment ⇒ restoration of immune response
        - majority of opportunistic infections = treated 10-14gg before ARV
        - exception: TB, cryptococcal meningitis (ARV after over 6 weeks post-treatment)
    - diagnosis >>>
        - screen for opportunistic infections before ARV treatment
        - **unmasking IRIS**
            - opportunistic infection develops after ARV treatment
        - **worsening IRIS**
            - pre-existing opportunistic infection worsens w/ ARV
    - treatment >>>
        - interrupt ARV if unmasking
        - NSAIDs/Corticosteroids if worsening
        - prevention of TB-associated IRIS (patients w/ HIV + TB) ⇒ prednisone (glucocorticoid for immune suppression)
