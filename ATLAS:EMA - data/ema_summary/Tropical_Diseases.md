    - ## Malaria
        - **epidemiology** >>>
            - Endemic in: subsaharan Africa, Asia, South America
            - Transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes
            - High-risk populations: children, pregnant women
        - **Pathophysiology**: >>>
            - Caused by  *Plasmodium*  species - primarily  *Plasmodium falciparum, but also P.ovale, P.malariae, P.vivax*  
            - Vector: Anopheles mosquitos ( and a human host)
            - Resistant Host if: Sickle cell anemia, G6PD def., thalassemia, newborns up to 6 months
            - incubation 7-30 days (even more in plasmodium malariae)
            - The lifecycle begins with the mosquito injecting sporozoites into the bloodstream ⇒ which migrate to the liver (can stay there for years) ⇒ multiply ⇒ and then infect RBCs ⇒ leading to their destruction
        - **Clinical Manifestations:** >>>
            - onset up to months after infection!
            - Symptoms include: fever, chills, sweating, headache, nausea, and vomiting
            - Severe cases can lead to **cerebral malaria**, **severe anemia**, and **acute respiratory distress syndrome, Blackwater fever** 
            - Signs include **splenomegaly** and **hepatomegaly**
