- what is it? >>>
    - a localized collection of pus within the brain parenchyma
    - typically begins as cerebritis (focal brain inflammation), which encapsulates within 5 days, forming a mass
    - early diagnosis - crucial for reduced mortality
- etiology >>>
    - the origin & causative organisms can vary a lot
    - otogenic
        - most common in past, now less
        - often by Streptococcus species (both aerobic & anaerobic) - bacteria are common oral flora
        - spreading from otitis media & mastoiditis
    - post-traumatic/post-operative
        - increasingly common due to surgical procedures
    - hematogenous - spread via bloodstream
        - common in immunocompromised (cancer pat. under chemo, transplant recipients)
        - Gram- bacteremia is important RF in neutropenic patients
    - other
        - Toxoplasma gondii - most common cause in HIV patients
        - Listeria monocytogenes
        - Tuberculosis - leading cause in low-income countries
- 
- Localization & symptoms >>>
    - the abscess location provides clues to its origin
    - frontal lobes ‒ often from sinusitis
    - temporal lobes/cerebellum ‒ often from otitis media
    - multiple sites ‒ suggest hematogenous spread, require investigation of primary source
    - symptoms ‒ highly variable but commonly include:
        - headache
        - AMS - Altered Mental Status
        - fever
        - <50% of cases present all 3
        - neurological symptoms depend on mass size, location, edema
- 
- Diagnosis >>>
    - Imaging
        - CT scans reveal round lesion with hypodense center (pus) & surrounding edema
        - MRI provides better visualization of abscess & surrounding edema
        - MRI is superior to CT in detecting early abscesses & assessing extent of edema
    - other
        - lumbar puncture, avoided due to risk of herniation
            - if performed, show ↑ WBC & protein levels
        - blood culture might identify causative organism, but often negative
        - surgical aspiration or biopsy, often necessary for definitive diagnosis
- management >>>
    - antibiotics
        - empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated on suspected source & patient RF
        - selection refined once causative organism is identified 
        - treatment 4-6 weeks
    - corticosteroids
        - to reduce cerebral edema
    - surgical intervention
        - neurosurgical consultation recommended for all brain abscesses
        - surgical excision or aspiration (needle drainage)
        - choice depends on abscess size, location & response to medication

- 
- Infection vs Colonization >>>
    - infection
        - presence of microorganism **with** alteration of organ/tissue structure or function
        - clinical symptoms are present
    - colonization
        - presence of microorganism **without** alteration of organ/tissue structure or function
        - no clinical symptoms
- anitmicrobial stewardship >>>
    - the responsible use of antimicrobials to prevent development & spread of antibiotic resistance
    - so to decrease the spread of drug-resistant organisms
- Microbiota interactions >>>
    - interactions between host's microbiota & pathogens influences disease development
    - lactobacilli VS candida ‒ reduction in lactobacilli can lead to candidiasis
    - clostridioides difficile ‒ antibiotic-induced dysbiosis can lead to C.difficile infection - potentially causing megacolon & death
- 
- Infectious Disease - transmission routes >>>
    - airborne ‒ droplets (influenza, meningitis, tuberculosis)
    - contact ‒ direct contact with lesion or surfaces (erysipelas, varicella)
    - fecal-oral ‒ ingestion of contaminated food/water (HAV, Salmonella)
    - Sexual ‒ sexual contact (STIs)
    - Vector-borne ‒ through arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, fleas)
- 
- Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) >>>
    - defined as fever>38.3ºC for at least 3 weeks w/out a diagnosis after 3 days of investigation
    - diagnostic approach ‒ systemic approach ideally:
        - detailed history: travel, occupation, hobbies, animal contact, sexual history, drugs
        - physical examination
        - laboratory investigations: CBC, inflammatory markers, blood culture, imaging (chest X-ray, CT, MRI)
        - metagenomics & next-gen sequencing ‒ used to identify unusual or unknown pathogens
- 
- Infection Disease consultation ‒ questions >>>
    - travel history (recent travel to endemic areas)
    - vaccination status
    - occupational/hobby exposure
    - animal contact (wild or domestic)
    - contact w/ others w/ similar symptoms 
    - dietary history (potentially foodborne)
    - Immunodeficiency 
    - previous infections (history of recurrent or unusual infections)
    - use of devices/prostheses
    - antibiotic allergies
- infection disease consultation - considerations >>>
    - epidemiology - understanding local prevalence of infections
    - common vs uncommmon pathogens - consider both 
    - source control - addressing primary source of infection is crucial
    - iatrogenic causes - some medication (incl. antibiotics) can cause fever
- 
- Antibiotic Resistance >>>
    - major global health threat
    - overuse of antibiotics contributes to selection & spread of resistant bacteria
    - MDR pathogens are increasingly common ‒ leading to treatment failures & increased mortality
