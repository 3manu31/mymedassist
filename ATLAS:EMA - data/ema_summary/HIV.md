- history >>>
    - 1st identified in 1981 in USA after some homosexual men presented w/ rare Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) & Kaposi's sarcoma - both indicative of severe immunosuppression
    - 1983 virus was isolated by French researchers who later got Nobel Prize
    - is believed to have originated from Simian Immunodeficiency Virus in Central Africa via zoonotic spillover - prob in early 20th century
    - 1987 first antiretroviral drug zidovudine
    - 1996 development of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) - transforming HIV from fatal disease to chronic condition
- structure >>>
    - retrovirus w/ lipid envelope, matrix, capsid
    - 2 RNA molecules
    - 3 key enzymes - reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease (cleaves viral polyproteins into functional proteins) - each enzyme is a target for specific antiretroviral drugs
    - viral envelope contains glycoproteins gp120 & gp41 - for viral entry into host cell
    - genome includes structural proteins (gag, pol), regulatory proteins, & accessory proteins
- classification >>>
    - belongs to Lentivirus genus of Retroviridae family
    - 2 main phylogenetic types: HIV-1 & HIV-2 - genetic diversity determines effectiveness of diagnostic & treatment strategies
- glycoproteins >>>
    - gp120 mediates attachment to host cell receptor CD4
    - gp41 mediates fusion of viral & host cell membranes
    - interaction between gp120 7 CD4 is highly specific, involving coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 - can create viral inhibitors for antiretrovirals
- HIV-2 >>>
    - less pathogenic & less easily transmitted than HIV-1
    - primarilly found in West Africa
    - HIV-2 has slower rate of disease progression & is associated w/ lower viral load
- HIV  Life cycle >>>
    - attachment - viral gp120 binds to host cell CD4 r. - target of some antiretrovirals
    - fusion - viral gp41 meidates fusion - fusion inhibitors for retrovirals
    - reverse transcription - reverse transcriptase converts viral RNA ⇒ to dsDNA -reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
    - integration - integrase integrates viral DNA into host cell genome - integrase inhibitors
    - transcription - viral DNA transcribed into viral RNA - target of some antiretrovirals
    - translation - viral RNA translated into viral proteins - translation inhibitors
    - assembly - viral proteins & RNA assemble into new virions - assembly inhibitors 
    - budding - new virions bud from host cell membrane - budding inhibitors
    - maturation - viral protease cleaves viral polyproteins into functional proteins - protease inhibitors preventing maturation
    - combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) uses multiple drugs to minimize development of drug resistance
- HIV transmission >>>
    - transmission routes - sexual contact (vaginal, anal, oral), blood-borne (blood transfusions, needle sharing), vertical (pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding)
    - risk of transmission vaires depending on route of exposure, viral load, presence of other STIs
- Risk Factors >>>
    - multiple sex partners
    - unprotected sex
    - IV drug use
    - blood transfusions before 1985 (before Ag tests)
    - mother-to-child transmission
    - understanding RF, is crucial for effective prevention strategies
- epidemiology >>>
    - millions of people live w/ HIV 
    - highest prevalance in sub-Saharan Africa
    - key populations: MSM, ppl who inject drugs, transgender women, sex workers - require targeted prevention & treatment
    - cascade of care 95-95-95: public health strategy aiming for 95% of ppl w/ HIV to know their status, 95% of those diagnosed to receive ART, & 95% of those on ART to achieve viral suppresion - we need efforts to improve HIV testing, treatment access & adherence
- 
- HIV pathogenesis & Immunological effects >>>
    - CD4+ T cell depletion - HIV primarily infects CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to their progressive depletion ⇒ impairing immune system's ability to fight off disease & infections
    - opportunistic infections - individuals w/ advanced HIV infection (AIDS) are susceptible to wide range of opportunistic infections (Kaposi's sarcoma, Tuberculosis) - type of infection that occurs depending on level of immunosuppression
    - HIV disrupts immune system balance & immune activation
    - HIV infection is associated w/ shift towards TH2-dominant immune response - leading to increased susceptibility to allergies & other autoimmune disorders
    - CCR5 & CXCR4 coreceptors are required for HIV entry into host cells - individuals w/ deletion in the CCR5 gene are resistant to HIV infection
    - Elite controllers - a small percentage of individuals w/ HIV infection are able to control viral replication w/out antiretroviral therapy - studying these subjects 
- 
- Clinical manifestations of HIV infection >>>
    - Acute HIV infection
        - 1-3 weeks after infection
        - mono-like symptoms (fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue)
        - may be asymptomatic
        - is often missed bc symptoms are non-specific
    - asymptomatic phase
        - can last many years, w/ few or no symptoms
        - viral replication continues & immune system is gradually depleted
    - AIDS-defining illnesses 
        - opportunistic infections & cancers that occur when CD4+ cell counts fall below 200 cells/mm3 (normal 500-1,500/mm3)
    - AIDS-related complex (ARC)
        - a stage of HIV characterized by persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, chronic diarrhea, weight loss 
        - ARC represents the transition phase between asymptomatic infection and AIDS
- opportunistic infection examples >>>
    - Kaposi's sarcoma
    - tuberculosis
    - candidiasis
    - CMV infection
    - cryptococcal meningitis
    - CNS toxoplasmosis
    - molluscum contagiosum
    - multi-dermatomal herpes zoster (crossing midline)
    - the spectrum of infections depends on level of immunosuppression 
- 
- HIV diagnosis >>>
    - serological tests - enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Ab against HIV
    - 4th gen tests detect both antibodies & p24 Ag, allowing earlier diagnosis ~4-6 weeks
- treatment >>>
    - viral load testing
        - measures HIV RNA in blood - indicating viral replication levels
        - crucial for assessing treatment response & treatment decisions
    - CD4+ T cell count
        - measure CD4+ cells in blood, determining status of immune system
        - used to stage HIV infection & monitor disease progression
    - ART - AntiRetroviral Therapy
        - combination of drugs that suppress viral replication & improve immune function 
        - highly effective
- classes of ART drugs >>>
    - Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
    - non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
    - protease inhibitors
    - integrase inhibitors 
    - entry inhibitors (fusion inhibitors & CCR5 antagonists)
    - drug resistance
        - HIV can develop resistance to antiretroviral drugs
        - major challenge in HIV treatment, requiring careful monitoring & regimen adjustments
- Treatment goals >>>
    - viral suppression - undetactable viral load
    - improved immune function - ↑ CD4+ cell count
    - improved quality of life
    - prevention of opportunistic infections & AIDS-related complications
    - treatment goals are individualized and based on patient's clinical status & other factors
- 
- HIV prevention strategies >>>
    - safe sex practices (consistent & correct condom use, limiting number of sexual partners, avoid high-risk sexual behaviors)
    - needle exchange programs
    - STI testing & treatment
    - mother-to-child prevention strategies
    - a combo of strategies is most effective
    - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
        - daily oral medication (tenofovir/emtricitabine) that reduces risk of HIV infection in high-risk individuals - needs to be taken consistently
    - Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
        - antiretroviral medication taken after potential exposure to HIV to prevent infection
        - must be started within 72h after exposure to be effective
