- epidemiology >>>
    - estimated hundred of millions of new STI infections annualy
    - Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis - the most common ones - esp. in low income countries
    - trends - increasing rates of antibiotic resistance - esp. for gonorrhea & chlamydia
    - concerning rise in syphilis infections, esp. in MSM
    - Risk factors: Multiple sex partners, unprotected sex, inconsistent condom use, STI history, substance abuse
- classification of STDs >>>
    - curable STDs - infections that can be treated & eliminated w/ appropriate antibiotics or other medication
        - chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis & trichomoniasis
        - cure depends on specific pathogen, antibiotic susceptibility, patient adherence to medication
    - incurable STDs - infections that cannot be cured, but can be managed w/ medication to reduce symptoms & prevent transmission
        - HIV, HSV, HPV
        - management focuses on suppresing viral replication, managing symptoms & preventing complications (QWER-viral latency & pathogenesis course, challenges developing effective antiviral therapies)
    - also classification based on pathogen type:
        - bacterial STDs - caused by bacteria & are typicaly treatable w/ antibiotics - e.g. syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea - antibiotic resistance is a growing concert
        - viral STDs - caused by viruses & are generally incurable, but manageable w/ antiviral medications - e.g. HIV, HSV, HPV 
        - other STDs - fungi (candida), protozoa (trichomonas vaginalis), ectoparasites (lice, scabies) - treatment depends on specific pathogen
- Bacterial pathogens causing STDs:
    - Chlamydia trachomatis >>>
        - obligate intracellular bacterium
        - cause urethritis, cervicitis, PID & LGV
    - Neisseria gonorrhea >>>
        - Gram- diplococcus

    - Treponema pallidum >>>
        - spirochetes causing syphilis
        - has primary, secondary, tertiary stages
            - 1º primary lesion at site of infection, goes away on its own
            - 2º spreads to lymph & blood vessels & cause systemic rash - infectious
            - latent - dormant stage for up to many years - after it we get either recurrent 2º or if immunosuppresed or untreated, we get 3º
            - 3º - most severe, cause CNS & circulatory problems, neurosyphilis, gumma (granuloma formation) 
    - Haemophilus Ducreyi >>>
        - gram- bacullus
        - cause chancroid - a painful genital ulcer
        - can also cause inguinal lymphadenopathy
- Viruses causing STDs:
    - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) >>>
        - cause genital warts
        - linked to cervical, anal & other cancers
        - many strains exist, some high-risk, & some lower-risk
    - Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) >>>
        - cause genital herpes
        - characterized by painful blisters & sores
        - HSV-2 primarilly associated w/ genital herpes, while HSV1, with oral herpes
    - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) >>>
        - causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - leading to severely compromised immune system
- Protozoa causing STDs >>>
    - trichomonas vaginalis - causing trichomoniasis - affecting vagina & urethra
- Fungi causing STDs >>>
    - candida - causing candidiasis - a yeast infection affecting vagina, penis & other areas
- Ectoparasites causing STDs >>>
    - pediculus humans pubis (pubic lice)
    - Sarcoptes scabiei (scabies)
    - not strictly STIs but can also me transmitted sexually
- Clinical manifestations of STDs >>>
    - genital ulcers - painful ulcers charateristic of chancroid (Haemophilus Ducreyi) & herpes genitalis (HSV) 
        - **non-painful ulcers are characteristic of syphilis!!!** 
    - urethritis/cervicitis/proctitis - symptoms: discharge, pain during urination, bleeding - associated w/ chlamydia & gonorrhea
    - genital warts (condyloma acuminata) - by HPV - small flat OR large cauliflower-shaped warts - on genitals, anus & surrounding areas
    - Pelvic Inflammatary Disease - chlamydia & gonorrhea - affecting fallopian tubes & ovaries - abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge
    - others:
        - vaginal discharge, itching, pain during urination - trichomoniasis
        - vaginal or penile itching, burning & discharge - candidiasis
        - scabies - intense itching & rash
- Diagnosis & Treatment of STDs 
    - Diagnostic tests >>>
        - depend on suspected infection:
        - microscopy, culture, PCR, serology (detect Ab against pathogen in blood)
    - Treatment >>>
        - depends on pathogen
        - antibiotics used for bacteria, & antivirals for viruses
    - Diagnosis & Treatment - Chlamydia >>>
        - Chlamydia trachomatis - PCR / culture
        - azithromycin, doxycycline
    - Diagnosis & Treatment - gonorrhea >>>
        - Neisseria gonorrhea - culture / PCR
        - ceftriaxone, azithromycin (often combined)
    - Diagnosis & Treatment - syphilis >>>
        - Treponema pallidum - serology / dark-field microscopy (bc tiny!)
        - Benzanthine penicillin
    - Diagnosis & Treatment - Trichomoniasis >>>
        - Trichomonas vaginalis - microscopy / PCR
        - metronidazole
    - Diagnosis & Treatment - genital herpes >>>
        - Herpes simplex virus - PCR, viral culture, serology
        - acyclovir, valacyclovir
    - Diagnosis & Treatment - genital warts >>>
        - HPV - visual inspection, colposcopy
        - topical treatments / LEEP / surgical removal
    - scabies >>>
        - dermatoscope - itchy all over body (mostly knees & palms), increased at night 
        - transmission through prolonged contact - ectoparasite
        - permethrin cream - leave overnight, then repeat after 1 week - also quarantine clothes etc.
        - ivermectin pill - once & then once again after 1 week - contraindication for pregnant women & <15kg kids
        - also crusted scabies - in immunosuppresed individuals - thousands of mites on individual, compared to ~10 in classic scabies
    - lice >>>
        - pubic lice - on pubic hair and armptis
        - can carry other diseases - Epidemic Typhus - caused ↑ mortality before antibiotics - classified as category B-bioterrorism agent!
- Prevention of STDs >>>
    - the most effective is abstinence - the only reliable
    - practicing safe sex - condoms (correctly & consistently) + monogamy
    - partner notification - inform past sexual partners about STI diagnosis
    - vaccination - available for HPV - can prevent certain types of cervical, anal cancers
    - regular screening - to detect early, & even asymptomatic - also PrEP & PEP for HIV
