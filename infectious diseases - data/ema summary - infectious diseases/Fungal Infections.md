- fungi >>>
    - eukaryotic, heterotrophic microorganisms
    - digest food externally using hydrolytic enzymes - explains ability to invade blood vessels, often causing hemorrhage 
    - primarily aerobic
    - synthesize lysine
    - plasma membranes contain ergosterol
    - reproductive units: conidia (asexual) & spores (can have asexual or sexual origin)
- yeasts VS molds >>>
    - yeasts ‒ single-celled fungi reproducing by budding
    - molds ‒ multicellular fungi forming hyphae (filaments)
    - dimorphic fungi ‒ exhibit both yeast & mold forms, depending on environmental conditions (T, CO2, pH) - grow as yeast or spherules in vivo or at 37ºC in vitro, and as molds at 25ºC
    - classification based on morphology is crucial for identification & understanding the potential severity of infection
- 
- classification of fungal infections, based on >>>
    - site of infection:
        - superficial
        - cutaneous
        - subcutaneous
        - systemic
    - route of acquisition:
        - exogenous (airborne, cutaneous, percutaneous)
        - endogenous (from normal flora (e.g. candida in GI) - particularly common in immunocompromised
    - virulence:
        - primary pathogens infect healthy individuals
        - opportunistic pathogens infect immunocompromised hosts
- 
- 
- diagnosis of fungal infections - depend on: >>>
    - clinical presentation:
        - symptoms vary depending on fungus & site of infection
        - thorough history, traveling history & underlying medical conditions - taken into consideration
    - miroscopic examination:
        - examination of specimens - tissue biopsies - to identify fungal elements (hyphae, yeast)
        - gram staining for initial assessment
    - culture:
        - the GOLD STANDARD
        - on selective media
        - for definitive diagnosis - but can be time-consuming
    - serological tests:
        - detection of fungal Ag & Ab in serum
        - for rapid diagnosis, but limitation in sensitivity & specificity
    - molecular diagnostics:
        - PCR-based methods for rapid & sensitive fungal DNA detection
- 
- 
- Antifungal Treatment >>>
    - treatment choices depend on fungus, site of infection & host factors
    - Major classes:
        - Azoles: inhibit ergosterol synthesis (e.g. fluconazole)
        - echinocandins: inhibit cell wall synthesis
        - polyenes: bind to ergosterol, disrupting membrane integrity (e.g. amphotericin B)
    - Drug resistance:
        - Candida auris & azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus - significant concerns due to resistance to commonly used antifungals
- 
- specific fungal infections >>>
    - Candida Infections
    - Aspergillus Infections
    - murcomycosis (zygomycosis)
    - Histoplasmosi
- 
- 
- Candida Infections >>>
    - candidemia - requires prompt treatment with echinocandins or amphotericin B
        - source control is crucial
    - invasive candidiasis - can affect multiple organs (kidney, liver, lungs, CNS)
        - RF: neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, indwelling devices
    - mucocutaneous candidiasis ‒ oral thrush, esophagitis, vulvovaginitis
- 
- Aspergillus Infections >>>
    - Invasive Aspergillosis
        - severe infection - esp. in immunocompromised
        - RF: neutropenia, corticosteroids & hematopoietic stem cell transplant
        - treatment: azoles, often combined with echinocandins
    - Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)
        - Hypersensitivity reaction in patients with asthma
        - characterized by elevated IgE levels, eosinophilia
- 
- Mucormycosis (zygomycosis) >>>
    - caused by Mucorales
    - characterized by ribbon-like hyphae with septations
    - RF: diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis), glucocorticoid use, hematologic malignancies
    - often presents with rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement - requiring surgical debridement & antifungal therapy (amphotericin B, azoles)
        - so involves sinuses, eyes, & brain
- 
- Histoplasmosis >>>
    - caused by Histoplasma capsulatum - found in soil contaminated w/ bird or bat droppings
    - most infections are asymptomatic or mild - severe disease can involve lungs or disseminate to other organs
    - treatment depends on severity ‒ may involve azoles, or amphotericin B
