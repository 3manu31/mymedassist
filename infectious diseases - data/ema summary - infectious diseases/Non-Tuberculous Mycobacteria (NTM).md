- what are they? >>>
    - a large group of mycobacteria that are distinct from M.tuberculosis complex (M.tuberculosis, M.bovis, M.africanum, etc.)
    - there are over 150 species, about 60 considered potentially pathogenic to humans
- classification by growth rate >>>
    - Rapid growers (RGM): colony formation <7 days - M.abscessus particularly associated with CF patients
    - Slow Growers: colony formation 7-40 days - e.g. M.avium complex, M.xenopi
    - Intermediate Growers: conoly formation 7-10 days - e.g. M.marinum, M.gordonae
- classification by pathogenicity >>>
    - considering likelihood of causing disease in immunocompetent vs immunocompromised hosts
    - some are rarely pathogenic, even in immunocompromised individuals, while others are opportunistic pathogens requiring significant immune suppresion to cause disease
- Epidemiology >>>
    - found in various environments - e.g. soil, water, dust - its widespread distribution contributes to potential human infections
- transmission routes >>>
    - inhalation - most common, primarily through aerosolized particles from contaminated water
    - ingestion - contaminated food/water
    - direct contact - cutaneous inoculation through wound or skin lesions
    - M.abscessus potentially limited person-to-person transmission - esp. in CF patients
- risk factors >>>
    - Immunosuppresion (HIV, under immunosuppressive medication, other immunodeficiencies)
    - underlying lung disease (CF, COPD, bronchiectasis, create favorable environment for NTM colonization)
    - others (age, genetic predispositions (CFTR gene), etc.
- NTM & amoebas >>>
    - some NTM species can survive & replicate within free-living amoebas
    - providing protection from environment & contribute to â†‘ antibiotic resistance
    - amoebas in water, pose significant risk to immunocompromised individuals 
- Clinical Presentation of NTM infections >>>
    - Pulmonary Disease
        - the most common manifestation
        - often presenting as chronic bronchopulmonary disease
        - symptoms non-specific ~ chronic (productive) cough, fatigue, weight loss, sometimes hemoptysis
        - radiological findings: nodules, cavities, bronchiectasis 
        - frequent cause: M.avium complex (M.avium, M.chimaera)
    - Extrapulmonary Disease
        - NTMs can infect extrapulmonary sites, although most frequently lungs
        - Lymphadenitis: painless cold lymph nodes - mostly affecting children
        - Disseminated Disease: most common in severely immunocompromised individuals
        - Skin & Soft Tissue Infections: caused by RGM, following skin lesion
        - Bone & Joint Infections: following trauma or surgery
        - Catheter-related Infections: RGM associated w/ Central Venous Catheter (CVC) & peritoneal catheter infections
- NTM diagnosis >>>
    - microbiological diagnosis:
        - isolation of the same NTM species from at least 2 separate sputum samples or from a bronchoalveolar lavage sample (BAL)
        - PCR increasingly being used, but may not be as specific as culture
    - Radiological diagnosis:
        - chest-xrays & High resolution tomography (HRCT)
        - findings may include nodules, cavities, bronchiectasis 
- NTM infections treatment >>>
    - often long - 12-24 months
    - requires multiple antibiotics, and may have significant side effects
    - the choice of antibiotics depends on specific NTM species & its susceptibility profile
    - macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin), ethambutol, rifampin or rifabutin are usually used in combination
    - for M.abscessus, treatment is challenging & may involve IV therapy, followed by prolonged oral regimens
    - NTM infections are generally difficult to treat bc of antibiotic resistance, slow growth rates, biofilm formation
    - inhaled Liposomal Amikacin - new antibiotic option under development, reduced toxicity, used for multiple drug resistant strains
