- what is it >>>
    - an infection of the bone
    - can range from localized to a severe systemic illness
- acute osteomyelitis >>>
    - infection lasting days to weeks, with rapid onset of symptoms
- chronic osteomyelitis >>>
    - infection lasting months to years
    - often involves recurrent episodes & formation of sequestra
- sequestra >>>
    - pieces of necrotic bone that separte from viable bone
    - the hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis
    - impede healing
    - their presence often needs surgical removal
- sinus tract >>>
    - pathognomonic feature of osteomyelitis
    - abnormal passage leading from a deep infection to the skin surface
    - often drains pus
- involucrum >>>
    - new bone formation surrounding the area of infection
    - basically the body's attempt to wall off infection
- periosteal seeding >>>
    - spread of infection from bone to periosteum 
    - can lead to further inflammation & bone destruction
- cloacae >>>
    - multiple draining passages that can form in chronic osteomyelitis
    - often interconnected & can make treatment more challenging
- bone ischemia >>>
    - reduced blood flow to bone
    - major factor in development of osteomyelitis - as it compromises ability to fight infection
- 
- 
- classification of osteomyelitis >>>
    - hematogenous & Non-hematogenous
- 
- hematogenous osteomyelitis >>>
    - bacteria reach bone via bloodstream
    - more common in children & can affect multiple sites
    - common pathogens: S.aureus, Beta-hemolytic streptococci, M.tuberculosis, Candida species
- hematogenous osteomyelitis - RF >>>
    - Diabetes mellitus
    - Intravenous drug use
    - Chronic kidney disease / hemodialysis
    - Immunosuppression
    - endocarditis
    - Age (young children, elderly)
    - vascular & orthopedic devices
- 
- Non-hematogenous osteomyelitis >>>
    - infection spreads directly to bone from adjacent tissues
    - more common in adults 
    - often associated with trauma or surgery
    - common pathogens: S.aureus, Coag-negative staphylococci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, corynebacteria, fungi, mycobacteria
- Non-hematogenous osteomyelitis - RF >>>
    - poorly healing wounds (diabetic foot ulcers, decubitus ulcers)
    - orthopedic hardware
    - diabetes
    - peripheral vascular disease
    - peripheral neuropathy
- 
- Diagnosis >>>
    - culture ideally on bone biopsy sample - culture from other sources (swabs, sinus tracts) are prone to contamination & false-negative results
    - blood cultures - may be positive in hematogenous osteomyelitis - but can be negative if bacteremia has resolved by time of diagnosis
    - imaging
- diagnosis - imaging >>>
    - for acute (<2 weeks) ‒ CT or MRI for early detection
    - for chronic (>2 weeks) ‒ MRI needed for complete assessment
    - diabetic foot infections - MRI
    - if there's metal hardware ⇒ nuclear imaging (e.g. bone scan)
- Laboratory findings >>>
    - ↑ WBC 
    - ↑ ESR - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate
    - ↑ CRP
- 
- 
- Treatment >>>
    - antibiotic therapy
    - surgical debridement 
        - removal of infected bone & tissue
        - essential for chronic osteomyelitis & cases w/ significant bone dmg or sequestra
    - hardware removal
        - might be necessary in cases of infection involving orthopedic implants
    - non-hematogenous ⇒ often needs prolonged (6+weeks) IV or high bioavailability oral antibiotics, + surgical debridement
    - hematogenous ⇒ less duration of antibiotic treatment (~4w) + generally w/out surgical debridement
- 
- 
- specific forms of osteomyelitis >>>
    - **vertebral osteomyelitis (spondylodiscitis)** 
        - infection of the vertebrae & intervertebral discs
        - often presents w/ back pain - potentially leading to spinal deformities & neurological complications
        - S.aureus is the most common pathogen
    - **Sternoclavicular & Pelvic Osteomyelitis** 
        - more common in IV drug users - due to risk of bacteremia
    - **Long bone Osteomyelitis ** 
        - more common in children
- 
- 
- Diabetic foot infections & Osteomyelitis >>>
    - a significant complication of diabetes (50% of diabetics) - foot ulcers ‒ often leading to osteomyelitis
    - RF: neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease & Immunosuppression increase the risk (not only diabetes), previous foot ulcer (50% recurrence within 5y)
        - neuropathy ‒ present in 80% of diabetic foot patients, leads to loss of sensation, pain, pressure - impaired microcirculation
        - peripheral vascular disease ‒ reduced blood flow to feet - poor wound healing
    - other RF: socioeconomic status, age, ethnicity, foot deformities
    - treatment: precise debridement, wound care, pressure reduction & antibiotic therapy (tailored to severity of infection & presence of osteomyelitis)
- 
- 
- prosthetic joint infections (PJI) >>>
    - infection involving joint prosthesis, classified by onset of timing (early, delayed, late)
    - RF: comorbidities, prior infections, prolonged surgery, S.aureus bacteremia!
    - diagnosis: imaging, serum markers, synovial fluid analysis
    - treatment: antibiotics - amputation if necessary, DAIR (debridement, antibiotics, implant retention)
