- intro
    - CNS highly sensitive to infection >>>
        - due to limited space & fragile structures
        - so increase in volume (e.g. inflammation, mass) can cause rapid & severe complications
    - cause of CNS infections >>>
        - infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, helminths) are the primary cause
        - some non-infectious conditions mimic CNS infections - e.g. cancer, autoimmune disorders, medications
    - clinical presentation >>>
        - variable depending on causative agent, location, patient factors
        - can ange from acute (hours to days), to subacute or chronic (weeks to months)
        - common symptoms: fever, headache, altered mental status (AMS)
        - possible seizures
    - differential diagnosis >>>
        - crucial bc potential for rapid deterioration
        - requires consideration of infectious & non-infectious causes
        - using: detailed history, neurological exam, laboratory tests 
    - Neuronal regeneration >>>
        - limited to specific areas (hippocampus, neuro-olfactory mucosa) - all others dont regenerate
    - gray vs white matter >>>
        - pathologies affecting gray matter (cortex) often cause seizures
        - white matter pathologies may present with neurological deficits & seizures
    - CNS anatomical barriers >>>
        - lack of defined anatomical barriers between bran, meninges & spinal cord allows rapid spread of infection
        - BBB - endothelial cells, pericytes & astrocyte end-feet - protecting brain parenchyma from blood-borne pathogens & toxins
        - Blood-CSF barrier - located in choroid plexus - less restrictive than BBB; viruses, drugs, toxins can cross more easily
        - areas without tight junctions - postrema, hypothalamus, 3rd ventricle - so more susceptible to drugs & toxins 
    - 
    - 
    - Meninges & CSF
        - meninges >>>
            - 3 layers of protective membranes surrounding brain & spinal cord
                - dura mater - outermost, tough fibrous, in contact w skull
                - arachnoid mater - web-like, contains arachnoid villi for CSF reabsorption - most commonly involved in meningeal infections
                - pia mater - delicate, directly adheres to brain & spinal cord - inflammation here directly affects neurotransmission
        - CSF >>>
            - clear, colorless fluid circulating around brain & spinal cord
            - avg volume: 150mL
            - produced by choroid plexus in each ventricle
            - circulates through subarachnoid space & is reabsorbed via arachnoid villi - turned over 3-4x daily
            - 2/3 iltrafiltrated plasma, 1/3 brain EC fluid
            - contains proteins, glucose, lymphocytes
            - changes in composition or pressure are significant indicators of disease
    - 
    - Lumbar Puncture (LP) >>>
        - sterile procedure to collect CSF for analysis
        - performed between L3-L4 or L2-L3 to avoid spinal cord injury
        - complications - headache most common, infection, local bleeding, brain herniation (most serious, potentially fatal)
    - 
    - CSF analysis >>>
        - routine:
            - cell count - ↑ WBCs indicate infection - ↑ RBCs indicate hemorrhage
            - glucose - ↓ suggests bacterial infection - bc they consume it
            - protein - ↑ indicates inflammation or BBB disruption
            - gram stain - to identifiy bacteria
            - culture - to identify & isolate bacteria or fungi
        - additional more specific:
            - india ink/cryptococcal antigen - for cryptococcal meningitis
            - IgM / IgG - for certain viral infections
            - cytology - to rule out malignancy
        - Reibergram - measures albumin & IgG in CSF & serum to assess BBB integrity & intrathecal IgG synthesis
        - Normal CSF - clear, colorless, <5 cells/mm3, glucose >50% of blood glucose, protein <59mg/dL

    - HIV status: HIV+; predominance of viral & fungal infections - HIV- predominance of unknown etiology cases
    - 
    - Routes of entry, to cause pathogenesis >>>
        - can enter the CNS through several routes
        - retrograde axonal transport - Herpesviruses (HSV, VZV) -  to reach brain
        - BBB crossing - some viruses (WNV, VZV) cross BBB directly or indirectly (within WBCs)
        - olfactory neurons - through olfactory bulb
        - Blood-CSF barrier crossing: CMV targets endothelial & ependymal cells
        - Choroid plexus: enteroviruses can enter directly into CSF
        - Once in CNS, pathogens trigger inflammatory response ⇒ lead to neuronal dmg & neurological dysfunction - inflammatory pattern varies & depends on pathogen
    - 
    - Clinical manifestations of Encephalitis >>>
        - classic triad: Headache, nuchal rigidity, fever (fever might be absent)
        - Altered Mental Status - key feature lasting over 24h
