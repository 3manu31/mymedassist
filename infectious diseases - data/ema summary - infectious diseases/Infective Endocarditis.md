- Epidemiology >>>
    - subjects with prosthetic devices in heart
    - elderly at risk
- 
- Etiology >>>
    - S.aureus - main one 
    - B.streptococci
    - Candida
- 
- Pathology >>>
    - most commonly occurs due to Sepsis and/or Systemic Embolization
    - presence of bacteria and/or fungi in bloodstream
    - bacteria attach to damaged valve surfaces, forming nonbacterial thrombotic vegetations, due to turbulence
    - bacteria proliferate within vegetation, protected from immune response
- 
- 
- clinical manifestations - symptoms >>>
    - acute form:
        - rapid onset of fever
        - chills
        - shortness of breath, chest pain
        - all occur after 1-2 weeks of bacteremia
        - commonly associated with S.aureus
    - subacute form:
        - milder symptoms, like low-grade fever
        - fatigue
        - weight loss
        - arthralgia
        - linked to less aggressive Coag- staphylococci
- 
- Clinical signs >>>
    - embolic phenomena
        - petechiae
        - Osler nodes - painful lesions on fingers/toes
        - Janeway lesions - painless macules on palms/soles
        - Roth spots - retinal emboli
    - Heart murmurs
        - new or worsening murmurs due to valvular dysfunction
- 
- transmission >>>
    - intravenous catheters or drug injections 
    - dental procedures or surgical interventions
    - individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, prosthetic valves, & IV drug users
    - so bacteria enter bloodstream through these routes
- 
- diagnosis >>>
    - clinical suspicion - based on symptoms, RF, physical examination
    - Blood cultures - must show bacterial presence
    - Imaging; echocardiography, essential for identifying cardiac lesions
    - criteria: 2 positive blood cultures + positive echocardiography
- 
- Treatment >>>
    - IV systemic HIGH dose Bactericidal antibiotics for 4 weeks & 6-8 weeks for patients w/ prosthetic valves
    - cardiac surgery - for severe cases w/ significant valvular dmg, uncontrolled infection, or large vegetations
- 
- complications >>>
    - risk for metastatic spread - secondary infections in kidneys, brain
    - local spread â‡’ valvular dmg, pericarditis
    - embolic complications - can lead to stroke, MI, organ dmg
