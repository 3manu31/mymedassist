- This workspace is for finetuning a language model as a medical study assistant.
- Prioritize exam-focused, and curriculum-aligned outputs.
- Expect raw lecture transcripts to contain artifacts (page numbers, headers, etc.) and teach the model through finetuning to ignore these.
- Study guides should be in markdown, self-contained, and optimized for exam preparation using the 80/20 rule.
