Jaundice
● definition of jaundice
Increased concentration of bilirubin in the blood resulting in a
yellowish staining of the skin surface and/or visible mucous
membranes or sclerae. Internal organs may also be affected.
● Jaundice can be caused by:
○ increase of unconjugated bilirubin, hydrophobic (liposoluble)
product, which cannot be excreted with urine; it can accumulate in
the blood, in the skin and in the mucous membranes)
○ increase of conjugated bilirubin (water-soluble), which can be
excreted in the urine
○ mixture of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin
● These different types of bilirubin depend on the problem that causes
the disease.
● what is bilirubin?
bilirubin is the toxic end product of heme degradation that is
processed in the liver, excreted in the bile
● explain the normal metabolism of bilirubin
1. heme (from senescent erythrocytes, erythrocyte precursors, P450
cytochrome enzymes, etc) is taken inside a phagocytic cell where
it is oxidized by heme oxygenase into biliverdin, which is in turn
converted into unconjugated bilirubin by biliverdin reductase
2. unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble, so it binds serum albumin
and transported to the liver
3. bilirubin is conjugated with one or two molecules of glucuronic
acid in the ER by bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucoronyl
transferase (UGT)
4. conjugated bilirubin is nontoxic and water soluble, it diffuses
through the cytoplasm into the biliary canaliculi and eventually
into the gallbladder where it will form bile (together with bile salts,
phospholipids, and cholesterol)
5. in the intestine most of it is de-conjugated by the flora (bacterial β-
glucuronidases) and degraded to colorless urobilinogen (or
bilinogen)
6. fate of urobilinogen:
◆ 80-90% oxidized by other intestinal bacteria and together with
bile pigment residues is excreted in feces: stercobilin
◆ 10-20% is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation
(terminal ileum and colon) and returned to the liver (portal
circulation) and excreted into bile
◆ a small amount of reabsorbed urobilinogen reaches the
systemic circle and is excreted in the urine: urobilin
● what is bile made up of?
○ bile salts (2/3)
○ bilirubin
○ phospholipids
○ cholesterol
● normal blood bilirubin levels
0.3-1.2 mg/dL
Hyperbilirubinemia: > 1.2 mg/dL
2 there’s jaundice
● what is the function of bile
○ emulsion and absorption of dietary lipids in the gut lumen through
the detergent properties of bile salts (they solubilize water-
insoluble dietary lipids)
○ neutralize stomach acid
○ helps to eliminate waste products (excess cholesterol and bilirubin)
● how are bile salts formed
by the conjugation of bile acids with taurine or glycine
bile acids are major catabolic products of cholesterol; they are water-
soluble sterols with carboxylated side chains
● what amount of bile acids are made and excreted by the liver in a day?
what is their fate?
The liver secretes from 12 to 36 g of bile acids a day and their fecal
loss is from 0.2 to 0.6 g a day.
● what happens to bile acids once in the gut lumen
95% are reabsorbed by the liver via the enterohepatic circulation
● clinical features of jaundice
Approach to the jaundiced patient: Clinical features
○ Urine color
○ Faeces color
○ Presence of associated symptoms
◆ itch
◆ ache
◆ nausea, vomiting
◆ asthenia
◆ temperature
○ Key Questions
◆ Taking toxic substances ?
◆ Ingestion of suspect foods?
◆ Contact with blood or derivatives
◆ History of cholelithiasis?
◆ Family history of jaundice?
● describe pre-hepatic jaundice
● It occurs when there is an excessive breakdown of red blood cells
that happens so fast that the liver is not able to process all of the
bilirubin, leading to an accumulation of the substance in the blood.
Often caused by
○ increased hemolysis
◆ sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, hemolytic anemia, favism or
G6PD defect, spleen hyper-functionality, spherocytosis,
elliptocytosis, bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases,
erythroblastosis fetalis (Rh-, Rh+)
○ defects in erythropoiesis
◆ thalassemia, mediterranean anemia (hemoglobin def),
pernicious anemia (B12 def), sideroblastic anemia (iron def),
leukemia, etc.
● In sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, the red blood cells are abnormal
and have a shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells, leading to an
increased breakdown of these cells. Hemolytic anemia, on the other
hand, is caused by the destruction of red blood cells by the immune
system or by external factors such as infections or exposure to certain
medications or chemicals.
○ Pleiochromic (dark) feces due to excess stercobilin
○ Hyper-chromic urine with lots of urobilin
○ in the fetus or newborn if severe accumulation unconjugated
bilirubin (20 mg/dl) it can lead to kernicterus(bilirubin induced
brain damage) The blood–brain barrier is not fully functional in
neonates and therefore bilirubin is able to cross into the central
nervous system.
● describe hepatic jaundice
Due to alteration of hepatic function impairing either the uptake, the
conjugation of bilirubin, or the excretion
Uptake defect:
○ decrease in ligandins amount or function:
◆ neonatal physiological jaundice (liver is not mature until 2
weeks post birth)
○ hepatic cellular damage (hepatitis)
◆ viral, drug induced.
○ Rotor syndrome (autosomal recessive mutation leads to loss of
function of the Organic Anion Transporter Proteins (OATP1)→ less
bilirubin taken up by the liver)
● Conjugation defect
○ UGT deficiency
◆ neonatal physiological jaundice
◆ Crigler-Najjar type I: complete absence or severe deficiency →
fatal around the time of birth
◆ Crigler-Najjar type II or Gilbert syndrome: decreased UGT
○ some drugs
● Hepatocellular jaundice with conjugated bilirubin:
○ congenital defect of conjugated bilirubin excretion (non lethal)
◆ Rotor syndrome
◆ Dubin-Jhonson syndrome: MRP2 transport protein deficient
(for the transport of conjugated bilirubin from hepatocyte to
bile duct) and up-regulation of MRP3 for its transport to the
blood
○ acquired cellular hepatic injury.
◆ drugs, pregnancy, hepatocellular damage, etc.
● Jaundice with mixed defects (uptake, conjugation and secretion):
● ○ Mixed hyperbilirubinemia: acute or chronic hepatopathies
● describe post-hepatic jaundice
Also called stasis jaundice or cholestatic jaundice
obstruction of bile excretion that leads to an accumulation of
conjugated bilirubin and bile.
The detergent properties of bile acids damage cells and activate
apoptosis; bile acids are hepatotoxic.
Clinical diagnosis:
○ increase in blood of compounds usually transferred to bile
(bilirubin, bile acids, CHOLESTEROL...)
○ itching (Excess of bile salts in the circulation cause irritation of
cutaneous nerve terminations)
○ steatorrhea (reduced bile formation → decreased absorption of
fats, and hypo-chromic feces)
○ hyper-chromic (dark) urine
○ Hepatomegaly
○ Chronic:
◆ Nutritional deficiency of liposoluble vitamin (A, D and K) related
to intestinal malabsorption.
◆ Cutaneous xanthomas (focal accumulation of cholesterol) due
to hyperlipidemia and altered cholesterol excretion
● Subtypes
○ Intrahepatic cholestasis: obstructions or alterations of the
intrahepatic biliary tract (between hepatocytes and main
interlobular bile ducts) due to
◆ biliary cirrhosis
◆ viral, bacterial, neoplastic, or toxic factors
◆ drugs (oral contraceptives, anabolic steroids)
○ Extrahepatic cholestasis: Occlusion of extrahepatic bile ducts
◆ gallstones (cholesterol, calcium salts),
◆ biliary tract tumors
◆ pancreatic tumors
◆ chronic inflammatory processes of the biliary tract
◆ lymphopathies of the hepatic hilum
◆ chronic sclerosing pancreatitis, etc.
● describe the histology of cholestasis
○ enlarged hepatocytes with bile droplets accumulating inside
○ dilated canaliculi
○ apoptotic cells (Detergent properties of bile acids damage cells
and activate apoptosis; bile acids are hepatotoxic.)
● Mechanisms of cholestasis
○ Damage of the canalicular plasma membranes(drugs, toxic
compounds..)causing a reduction in the bile transport
○ Alterations of canalicular membrane permeability: e.g: in
pregnancy, increase in estrogen can increase membrane
permeability of the biliary canaliculi favoring the retro-diffusion of
the bile components, causing cholestasis.
○ Alterations or inhibitions of contractile properties (actin) of
the canaliculus
◆ e.g. phalloidin toxin (found in death cap mushroom) binds to
actin and impairs the peristaltic-like activity of hepatocytes
promotes canalicular flow of bile.)

• Describe neonatal jaundice
○ Transient and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
○ considered physiological
○ (70%) of newborns; more pronounced in premature infants
○ Mechanisms of hepatic uptake, conjugation and biliary excretion
have nor been matured fully until about 2 weeks of age (normal
ligandin levels take longer)
◆ Low ligandin levels; hepatic UGT activity is 100 times lower
than that of the adult.
○ During pregnancy, Fetal bilirubin passes placenta and is
conjugated and excreted from the maternal liver.
○ May be exacerbated by breastfeeding: bilirubin-deconjugating
enzymes in breast milk.
○ Treatment with Phototherapy (blue light fluorescent lamps) light
absorption by unconjugated bilirubin generates water-soluble
isomers that can be excreted in the urine.
● What is mixed hyperbilirubinemia? describe its clinical characteristics
Hepatocellular damage caused by acute or chronic hepatopathies can
cause deficits in bilirubin uptake, glucuronation (conjugation) or
hepatocyte excretion. This is defined as mixed hyperbilirubinemia.
Clinical characteristics:
Excess in both an unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin can cause:
○ Bilirubin deposit in the subcutaneous fatty tissues (yellow
pigmentation)
○ conjugated bilirubin passes through the renal filter (dark urine)
○ increased transaminases
○ decreased albumin in the blood
○ reduced lipid absorption due to the deficit of bile salt production
(fattier stools but no steatorrhea)
○ Hypocholic feces
○ Reduced bowel transit
● Intrahepatic pregnancy cholestasis?
○ central-lobular cholestasis
○ Rare pathology characterized by increase in total bile acids and
intense itching, cholestasis, and jaundice.
○ It occurs in the last trimester of gestation (0.8%-1.5%) and has a
benign prognosis (complete remission after delivery).
○ Associated with premature birth, fetal distress and placental
insufficiency.
○ Uro-desoxycholic acid therapy attenuates itching
● Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn?
Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn (affects ≈
1:2500 live birth)
○ Infants who have jaundice beyond 14-21 days after birth risk of
neonatal cholestasis
● Major causes:
○ cholangiopathies: genetic and acquired biliary disorders. Can be
caused by:
◆ cystic fibrosis
◆ biliary atresia
◆ fibro-polycystic diseases
◆ disordered immunity (primarily biliary cirrhosis..)
◆ infectious agents (cytomegalovirus, bacteria...)
◆ ischemia
◆ toxic compounds (drugs, toxins..
○ primarily biliary atresia: complete/partial obstruction of the
lumen of the extrahepatic biliary tree within the first 3 months of
life (1/3 infants with neonatal cholestasis).
◆ aberrant intrauterine development
◆ destruction following birth due to
◇ viral infection : rotavirus, reovirus, cytomegalovirus
◇ auto-immune reactions);
○ Various disorders causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
(referred to neonatal hepatitis)
