The other 30% is represented by the vitamin A in the form of <strong>provitamin A</strong> present in vegetables, for example the <strong>carotenoids</strong> and <strong>beta-carotene</strong> is the main one present in vegetables, like in carrots. Beta carotene or vitamin A in the form of retinol is absorbed by the intestine and charged in <strong>lipoproteins</strong> called <strong>chylomicrons</strong>. These reach the liver and bind to specific receptors on hepatocytes that recognize the <strong>apolipoprotein E</strong> that surrounds chylomicros.

The <strong>food allergies</strong> mediated by IgE can be mediated by allergens and is characterized by the release of IgE. Usually give symptoms in a few minutes, hours so the reaction is fast, <strong>acute</strong>, sometimes very strong as in the case of anaphylaxis. An allergen stimulates the production of IgE. IgE are bound specifically to the mast cells, that we saw in acute inflammations. They are rich in granules that contain a lot of inflammatory mediators like histamine. In case of repeated exposure to allergen, so a second exposure to the allergen, the latter finds already IgE on the surface of mast cells so the binding of the allergen with the IgE leads to the explosive degranulation of the mast cells, and so all the vasoactive amines and histamine are released causing the allergic reaction.

Gluten is digested into lipopeptides creating some aminoacids and also lipopeptides that cannot be digested like <strong>gliadin</strong>. Gliadin is a 33 amino acid peptide. Gliadin stimulates enterocytes to produce <strong>zonulin</strong>. Zonulin binds specific receptors on the enterocytes and this binding leads to the contraction of enterocytes and the destruction of tight junctions. Gliadin is present at the surface of the lumen of our intestine stimulates the enterocytes to produce interleukin 15. <strong>Interleukin 15</strong> is able to stimulate the proliferation of the intraepithelial lymphocytes. The <strong>intraepithelial lymphocytes</strong> express on their surface this marker, <strong>NKG2D</strong> (not important to remember), and it is important because it allows the lymphocytes to recognize the enterocytes that have expressed <strong>MIC-A</strong> (ligand of the marker) and it is expressed by those enterocytes that are under stress (for example inflammation, altered microbiota and other stimuli). The epithelial lymphocytes attack the enterocytes expressing MIC-A and they destroy them, so they die of necrosis. Moreover in this way some spaces are created between the enterocytes and gliadin passes and enters the epithelium. At the same time gliadin also stimulates the epithelial cells to produce a molecule called <strong>osteogen</strong> that destroys the tight junctions, such as occludin, that are</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8169-b9f9-f977782f1e7d" class="">Carolina Gervasio.

It is an enzyme of enterocytes and in case of destruction of enterocytes it is released. The role of the enzyme is to deamidate the gliadin. So we have now a deaminidated gliadin. The deaminidated gliadin binds specifically to <strong>HLA-DQ2</strong> or <strong>HLA-DQ8</strong> that are present in the celiac disease patient that are on the surface <strong>antigen presenting cells (APC)</strong>. In turn this binding brings the activation of lymphocytes that produces specific antibodies that are IgA or IgG directed against gliadin, so they are <strong>antigliadin antibodies</strong> and <strong>anti-tTG</strong> that recognize the enzyme tissue transglutaminase and also <strong>anti-endomysium</strong>, that is that part of the subendothelium exposed at the damage of the endothethelial cells that expose the basal lamina and the endomesium. These antibodies reach the endomysium that is a self tissue, but it is normally not exposed. In this way, celiac disease can be considered an autoimmune disorder, because of the presence of these antibodies. When the <strong>antigliadin antibodies</strong> and <strong>anti-tTG</strong> act near the endothelium they damage even more the endothelium. So the cause of the destruction of the enterocytes are the intraepithelial leukocytes that directly kill the enterocytes or the antigliadin</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81b8-832c-e5e506e7a353" class=""><em>Fig. 16</em></p><figure id="2297904f-03a9-814f-a802-c5a09913e09d" class="image"><a href="nutritional%20diseases%202297904f03a981a7a445fac2fd17dcb9/image15.png"><img style="width:700px" src="nutritional%20diseases%202297904f03a981a7a445fac2fd17dcb9/image15.png"/></a></figure><p id="2297904f-03a9-8127-997a-e68e0760f273" class="">antibodies and anti-tTG that attack in</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-813e-9ec0-f45a894c1684" class="">the nearby of the enterocytes or the</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8148-9964-e6b723761eff" class="">anti-endomysium antibodies.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8174-b26c-fedb72c35792" class="">There is another type of diagnosis, the <strong>genetic diagnosis</strong>.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-816a-8cf7-fb250d11be7d" class="">So the trigger element is <strong>gluten</strong>, which is not a single protein but a complex of proteins.

These antibodies determine the atrophy and the loss of the villi of the intestine. This is clinical manifestation of the celiac disease. This happens always when a celiac patient eats some gluten by mistake, because also a little amount of gluten or a contamination may cause the atrophy of the villi and the clinical manifestations.

It seems complicated but I like to explain this because it can be useful. Here (top of the image) we have a patient with signs and symptoms (anemia, diarrhea and some general malaise). He first thing to do is to measure IgA anti-Transglutaminase, but also the total IgA to understand if the total quantity of IgA is normal, otherwise identifying a specific type of IgA may be difficult. If there is a positive result for IgA anti-Transglutaminase, we have to perform the duodenal biopsy. If there is a positive result, we see the atrophy of the villi and there is the certain diagnosis of celiac disease. Otherwise, if the IgA anti-Transglutaminase result is negative, we cannot exclude celiac disease because have have to evaluate whether the total IgA is lower than normal. If they are lower than normal we have to measure the other antibodies created in celiac disease: IgG anti-Transglutaminase and IgA anti-endomisium. If they are positive, the biopsy is performed and if the biopsy is positive the celiac disease diagnosis is confermed. Otherwise if the total IgA are normal and the anti-Transglutaminase are negative, it is unlikely that we have a celiac disease and the biopsy is not performed since it is an invasive procedure.</p><figure id="2297904f-03a9-8142-8dfc-fb839ddfaee6" class="image"><a href="nutritional%20diseases%202297904f03a981a7a445fac2fd17dcb9/image17.png"><img style="width:673px" src="nutritional%20diseases%202297904f03a981a7a445fac2fd17dcb9/image17.png"/></a></figure><p id="2297904f-03a9-8120-9c04-df1e03ef9c63" class=""><em>Fig. 18</em></p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8166-807e-e925908da5b3" class="">Carolina Gervasio.

They are difficult to diagnose but if you are not able to find any type of immunoglobulins you should consider the possibility of facing an intolerance. Intolerances could recognize enzymatic, pharmacological, food additives mechanisms. <strong>Lactose intolerance</strong> is more frequent than celiac disease. Lactose is a <strong>disaccharide</strong>. The most famous is lactose intolerance due to a <strong>deficit of lactase</strong>, the enzymes able to digest lactose dividing it in glucose and galactose. Lactase is present on the brush border of the small intestine. <strong>Deficit does not mean absence</strong>. If lactase is not present or present in low amounts, lactose remains as a disaccharide in the lumen and so as a consequence water brings to a very severe diarrhea. An intolerance is different from, for example, celiac disease in which we have an immune response. There are foods that contain histamine or other vasoactive amines and that if consumed together with an allergen, a reaction can occur. Or if we ingest foods that stimulate the degranulation of mast cells and the consequence is the release of histamine. It is not a immune reaction, because it is not the immune system that reacts but these foods already contain vasoactive amines.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81ac-af80-fbcda27aee05" class=""><em>She will not ask all the foods cited in the slides, they are only added for our interest.</em></p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81cc-8375-ffd2e6021003" class="">Now there are very good tests to detect lactose intolerance: breath test in which you measure hydrogen produced by respiration. The lactose is not broken down so it is fermented by our microbiota so consequently you have bloating, gut pain and diarrhea. The lactose intolerance incidence is <strong>30-40%</strong> but it is important the degree of severity.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8194-9410-fe4933afd79c" class="">Another intolerance due to enzymatic mechanisms is the <strong>intolerance to ethanol</strong>: ladies are much less tolerant to alcohol than men because they have <strong>30% less alcohol dehydrogenase in the stomach</strong>. Eastern people do not tolerate alcohol like western people because they have different isotypes of alcohol dehydrogenase (more active) so they produce more acetaldehyde and less active aldehyde dehydrogenase so the steady state amount of acetaldehyde is higher than western people. <strong>Food intolerances of pharmacological type</strong> are very frequent. There are foods containing high amounts of vasoactive amines, for instance fermented cheese, milk as well, giving a reaction similar to that occurring in allergies. The difference in the reactions between people is in the ability to eliminate vasoactive amines. Vasoactive amines may trigger the same reactions occurring in allergies. You could become intolerant just once because you ingest too many vasoactive amines: in this case it is an episode, I am not intolerant. The disease condition is when every time I eat, for example, gorgonzola, I am intolerant so it is a disease condition.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8162-b829-fa6bdece2aef" class="">There are foods able to favor degranulation of mastocytes, so you have a pseudoallergic condition but you do not find antibodies. These are difficult to diagnose, usually it is used in a food diary. In addition there are some foods that are <strong>inhibitors</strong> of the normal catabolism of serotonin (<strong>5-hydroxytryptamine</strong>), so <strong>inhibitors of monoaminoxidase</strong>, and in the case of <strong>histamine inhibition of diamine oxidase</strong>. Often the situation is complex so you have bigger content of vasoactive amines and also presence of inhibitors of amine catabolism and eventually in the case of histamine and serotonin, the catabolism leads to the production of imidazole acetate that means that aldehyde dehydrogenase is important. So the best competitive inhibitor of diamine oxidase or monoamine oxidase, meaning a good substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase is alcohol. If I eat food rich in histamine and I drink alcohol I impari the histamine removal and I keep the histamine levels high. Finally, the food intolerances could be due to ingestion of food additives: <strong>sulphites</strong> (present in wine, they are stressors of gastric mucosa), <strong>sodium benzoate</strong> (probably it causes impairment of vasoactive amines catabolism). <strong>Glutamate</strong> is still considered as a possible cause of food intolerance but it is still debated.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-811a-9d7a-eadd282a7f56" class="">Carolina Gervasio.
