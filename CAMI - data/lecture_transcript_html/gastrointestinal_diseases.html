The action of helicobacter pylori was discovered recently, only 10 years ago.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81b1-942e-e54b0cf7daf8" class="">What is the mechanism behind chronic gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori? Helicobacter pylori produces <strong>urease</strong>, which is an enzyme that hydrolyzes urea into CO2 and ammonia. Ammonia is used by the helicobacter pylori to maintain a basic environment around itself. On the other hand, the formation of CO2 in presence of the hydrogen ions can produce an increase in the acidic environment of stomach cavity. So, it can decrease the pH, and this acidic pH is able to cause damage to the stomach mucosa. In the meantime, the bacteria defends itself by surrounding itself in an environment full of ammonia.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8150-bf20-dc4a91db0748" class="">The different steps by which helicobacter pylori can induce damage are, first of all, the induction of an alteration in the morphology and in the function of the stomach. So, it induces atrophic gastritis which can also develop <strong>intestinal metaplasia</strong>. Intestinal metaplasia is a type of metaplasia when the tissue in the lower part of the stomach changes its morphology and becomes like the first part of the intestine (the fundus of the stomach becomes like the tissue in the tenue). There is also an alteration in the function of the intestine and so an alteration in the digestion of the upper part of the intestine. This is a metaplasia that can spread also in the lower parts of the intestine, which becomes <strong>colonic metaplasia</strong>: therefore the damage involves not only the stomach but also the intestine. In fact, it can be assumed that helicobacter pylori can be also a risk factor for intestinal damage. It causes dysplasia and carcinoma, in particular in the gastric portion. Helicobacter pylori induces not only damage by increasing the acidic environment of the stomach, but also because it expresses two types of proteins, which are <strong>VacA</strong> and <strong>CagA</strong>.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8179-9457-e2e838cd6a90" class="">The first one is <strong>vacuolizing cytotoxin-associated protein type A</strong> (VacA), which is able to induce the damage and cleave the membrane of the mitochondria. Between the two membranes of the mitochondria (remember that mitochondria have an external membrane, an internal membrane, and then a matrix in between) there is <strong>cytochrome C</strong>. If this external membrane is cleaved, cytochrome C is able to enter the cytoplasm and activate the apoptotic program. So, there is this activation by this protein expressed by the helicobacter pylori, which is associated with the induction of the damage, to the induction of apoptosis on mucosa cells, to the amplification of the gastric lesions, and therefore the progression towards the malignant phenotype.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81ef-8e7f-d6fa3a95eecd" class="">The other protein, called <strong>cytotoxin-associated genetypeA</strong> (CagA), expressed by helicobacter pylori, activates the tyrosine kinases. These tyrosine kinases are kinases or enzymes that are increased during the malignant progression because they are involved in the mitogenic response of the mucosal cells. Hence, in this case, the expression of this gene by the helicobacter pylori is associated with the progression of gastritis toward atrophy, and then cancer.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8139-a840-ef91983829a5" class="">There are three types of tests to diagnose the presence of Helicobacter pylori.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8169-a963-cae979d374bb" class="">Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-815b-8b5d-da8b40d25d49" class="">16</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8142-947d-c5902542e25c" class="">22.03.2023 BIASI L.2</p><figure id="2297904f-03a9-8130-a724-f0a421f23660" class="image"><a href="gastrointestinal%20diseases%202297904f03a981968792ff4597ddd35a/image9.png"><img style="width:431px" src="gastrointestinal%20diseases%202297904f03a981968792ff4597ddd35a/image9.png"/></a></figure><p id="2297904f-03a9-8180-a716-dd21f0335ec0" class=""><em>Fig.9</em></p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81b8-83e2-c348dbc9a790" class="">The first type is the <strong>breath test</strong> (fig.9) , which is based on the capacity of the helicobacter pylori to cleave urea into ammonia and CO2.

There is also the enzymatic attack by bacteria, because of the presence of the microflora in the lumen of the intestine. They are very important because they act by using their enzymes to cleave or to metabolize particular types of nutrients that are ingested.

The obstruction can also be due, not only to the physical presence of material, but also due to changes in the morphologies of the intestine. In this case, it is an abdominal <strong>hernia</strong> that induces an intrusion, due to a weakness of the wall of the abdominal intestine; we can also have <strong>abdominal adhesions</strong>, especially due to abdominal surgeries (fig.10). These intra-abdominal fibrous formations are frequent and in general they can</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81af-9704-ee73b0ad9f58" class="">link the peritoneal membrane and are due to abdominal surgery.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81a4-ad64-cc58492fe8d2" class="">The other can be <strong>volvulus,</strong> when there is a twisting of one of the segments of the intestine (hence, a segment becomes twisted on itself) on the mesenteric axis.

The main inflammatory diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases in the intestine, <strong>IBS</strong> and <strong>IBD</strong>. Irritable bowel syndrome is now considered also as <strong>chronic inflammation</strong>: only in the last few years this type of disease has been considered a <strong>pathophysiological disease</strong>. In the past, this was considered only a psychological disease. These patients suffer from abdominal pain, which can be intermittent and they can experience stipsi with diarrhea (there is an intermittent alteration between diarrhea and constipation). These types of diseases, like IBS, are now associated to have physiopathological importance because the action between the gastrointestinal function and the brain function is now physiologically considered: we have a link between the gut and the function of the central nervous system. The condition that links these two tissues is in general is now called the <strong>gut-brain axis</strong>. Why was in the past considered only as psychological damage and not physiological damage? Because these types of syndromes develop in patients that are stressed. So, they develop especially in the so-called Western countries (in the industrial countries), where the stress, due to the work and due to the lifestyle, is so high that can induce stress into the brain. So, in this case, the psychological stress of the brain, is linked also to the malfunction of the gut. On the other hand, if we have an alteration in the diet (for instance) and so we change, in particular, the bacterial flora (and so there is an alteration in the microbiota) we can induce a functional damage to the</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-813e-862e-e8c46cdc5e58" class="">Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8181-ac16-c2f4bbaa437b" class="">18</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8171-b7ac-da1eb0e1a757" class="">22.03.2023 BIASI L.2</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-812e-8580-f4297f287b05" class="">gut that is linked to the alteration of the brain. Hence, on one hand the diet and the change in the species of bacteria, and on the other hand the stress of the civilization. Therefore, this type of syndrome is considered to have different types of causes and is considered a <strong>multiple-probability disease</strong>. The main pathological factor, therefore, is the altered gut immune activation due to the alteration of the bacteria present in the gut, which are very important in our body. The increased intestinal permeability, the alteration of the junction between enterocytes and the alteration,due to the diet, of the bacteria, but also due to the continuous inflammation, the intestinal microbiota and the hypersensitivity of the patient. So this is an individual type of sensation it’s not an objective factor but it is a subjective factor, and, therefore, there is the alteration of the brain-gut interaction with an alteration in the autonomic nervous system which is in our intestine: this nervous system is the nervous system of the gut that is able to activate some neurological transmitters, which can be released and can reach the brain to induce alteration in the emotivity and the different type of sensations of our brain.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-819a-aa65-e5a674522cc6" class=""><strong>ROME III AND IV DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</strong></p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81f9-a7ce-f22d89a8efb8" class="">To diagnose this type of syndrome we have two diagnostic criteria, which are <strong>ROME III</strong> and <strong>ROME IV</strong> (with the latter being the most recent). They are very similar and are associated to the alteration of the sensation for abdominal pain but also to the objective changes in volume of the feces, and the passage of the stools, for example, throughout the intestine and so the motility into the intestine. Recurrent abdominal pain can be a discomfort (an uncomfortable sensation), not described as pain but aa a sensation of feeling not well. Following the Rome III criteria, this type of pain or discomfort has to appear at least three days per month, in the last three months; type of damage must be associated with two or more of these factors, which are the improvement of the condition with defecation, an onset associated with a change in the frequency of the passage of the stool (for example diarrhea), and an onset associated with the change in the form (in volume and in color) of the stool.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8133-a28d-ffda25e8a6d7" class="">Following Rome IV criteria it is very similar, the recurrent abdominal pain, on average, has to appear at least one day per week (not three days per month) in the last three months, associated with defecation and with a change in the frequency of stool, number and volume of the stool.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81b4-8fb1-d9b756eea07a" class="">Therefore, IBS is a multi-morbidity disease due to different types of symptoms associated also to the behavior, and most of the symptoms are linked to both physiological (such as gut physiology) and psychosocial factors. These two factors are linked by environmental factors: first of all is the change in our lifestyle, in the type of eating, in the type of drinking, but also in the type of living, which is very important. In fact, a gastroenterologist told the professor that there is nobody without inflammation like IBS. Only children are not inflamed during our life, because otherwise our hormones are irritated.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81d1-b424-c5aa0c676f6f" class="">Scian Pier Paolo, Bertozzi Alice</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-818e-a1de-c0ead77e6a00" class="">19</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81a5-b31e-dce49935f145" class="">23.03.2023 BIASI L.3</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81ac-80c7-ef29f0478d77" class=""><strong>INTESTINAL DISEASES PART 2</strong></p><p id="2297904f-03a9-817c-8e44-d266ca1087ff" class="">We now finish yesterday&#x27;s lesson concerning intestinal diseases (IBD).
