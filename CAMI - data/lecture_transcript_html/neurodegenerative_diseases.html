The neurons start to dysfunction and there is a reduction in the brain activity because of neuronal death. Sometimes the accumulation of these proteins is caused by mutations that can alter their conformation. Concerning this degenerative disease, we can observe the presence of abnormal proteins that are insoluble and cannot be degraded by enzymes of the tissue. The deposit of these proteins is toxic for the neurons and can provoke the death of neurons (after oxidative responses and inflammation). Sometimes the accumulation of these misfolded proteins occur because the mechanism that should eliminate/degrade them is impaired.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-8141-ab31-c5b4faeefe64" class="">The incidence of the diseases progressively increases due to the increase of the age (particularly after 65 years of age), but familial forms also exist.

Rarely, clinical symptoms appear before 50 years of age. It is very difficult to prevent all neurodegenerative diseases because the neurodegeneration starts many years before the clinical onset. We do not have drugs or specific therapeutic strategies to prevent or inhibit the progression of these diseases. The life expectancy of Alzheimer is 5-10 years. This disease is growing exponentially, and it has been estimated that 34% of the population older than 65 will be affected by this disease in 2050.

Therefore, this therapy has the aim of increasing the bioavailability of dopamine, in order to increase the stimulation of receptors and, as result, to control the execution of the movements. With this therapy, the rigidity and difficulty in doing normal movements are reduced.</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81a2-8390-d0d89079e794" class="">This treatment is effective especially at the beginning of the disease, to compensate for the decrease of dopamine produced by dopaminergic neurons during the initial phase, however it is not able to inhibit the progression of PD and it becomes less effective with the disease progression. As a consequence of this, some additional movement disorders can appear and in particular it is common to observe a disorder characterized by involuntary movements (dyskinesia).</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-812b-8238-de8e7335c888" class="">●Electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-817f-a9c2-ec0e6d277cae" class="">●Neural transplantation</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81cd-a904-d4b91011de65" class="">●Neural gene therapy</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-815d-985b-d7cc81a13c8f" class="">●Administration of neuroprotective agents to reduce oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation</p><p id="2297904f-03a9-81a4-82a0-ee8d4bcb2c07" class=""><strong>MORPHOLOGY</strong></p><p id="2297904f-03a9-814a-aa1e-f41e115ac0e3" class="">The substantia nigra is called “nigra” because this area has dark/grey color due to the presence of dopaminergic neurons.
