They are quite common and more common than everyone can expect because in the general population’s mind things like syphilis and gonorrhea are something from the 19th century, but they are still really common and in certain settings they cause epidemics. The epidemiology and the clinical impact of STDs will be explained and then few of these STDs will be discussed in order for you to get a basic knowledge of these diseases.   EPIDEMIOLOGY   Fig. 30 Referring to Fig. 30, the professor used some key facts on STDs from the WHO site in order to provide us with some numbers. Some of these numbers are unbelievable: everyday it is estimated that more than 1 million people will get an STD. All the other numbers are really high: for example, more than 500 million people have genital infections with Herpes, more than 300 million people have an HPV infection, although nowadays vaccination can change this number, for some other diseases it can't.  For example, vaccine for HPV is not available in certain countries.  The majority of STIs have no symptoms or only mild symptoms and therefore people are not seeking medical help and they are not treated for the disease. What is very relevant for HIV is that most STIs can significantly increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission and that most of these STIs can affect reproductive health. Syphilis during pregnancy will lead to several consequences for the newborn but also Chlamydia infections can cause infertility and may be transmitted to the newborns. Resistance to antibiotics is a concern in several areas starting from Southeast Asia and USA and is globally spreading, causing trouble in treating these infections.  In several papers there is a distinction between curable and non-curable STDs:  -  Non curable STDs include HIV, HSV, HPV (most of the viral infections);  -  Curable STDs are Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphilis and Trichomoniasis.  In this map Fig. 31 taken from 2012 review, in which incidence of curable STIs is divided per different regions, there are areas in which incidence of chlamydia is very high: it can be as high as 60.9 cases per 1000 inhabitants. In the American region, chlamydia is high but also trichomoniasis is high (27.4 cases out of thousand individuals), almost as in the African region, where it is even higher (37.4 cases out of thousand). There are some geographical variations but in most of the tropical areas the incidence is higher.  \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n18 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  Fig. 31 Figure 23 Fig. 32 Fig. 32 is taken from the ECDC website1 to give an idea of the distribution and of the confirmed syphilis cases per 100,000 population by country. You can see that certain countries have no surveillance data, such as France and some countries in the middle of Europe (e.g. Liechtenstein) but other countries that are actually active reporting cases of syphilis, mainly Spain, UK, Germany and some of the Baltic Republics, have a significantly high incidence above 7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.  In Italy, it seems to be low, but the professor thinks that there is a very high underreporting of cases due to the fact that syphilis must be suspected (often it is not) in order to be diagnosed and reported.  SYPHILIS TRENDS  These are the trends in the last 10 years showing a mild reduction in STDs among heterosexual individuals2 but a steep increase in all STIs in MSM (Men having Sex with Men)Fig. 33. Both in EU and in UK there is a constant increase in the number of infections reported, having MSM as a prevalent risk factor.   Fig. 33 Fig. 34 is about MSM in the UK. The blue line indicates HIV infection which increased from 1996, then there was a plateau and from 2014 only it is slightly decreasing due to the events pointed at by the black arrows. Look at Early syphilis in red, Gonorrhoea in green and Chlamydia in purple: you can see that all of them have markedly increased their incidence over time in recent years.  Here Fig. 35 there is a report of the STDs in Piedmont published in 2018, that refers to data collected in 2016. Gonorrhoea increased in the last 10 years, especially in men; syphilis is pretty stable (because of a decrease in women and an increase in men); \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n19 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) cases are mostly from 2009, due to the fact that before this date we didn't have the specific PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis so we weren’t able to diagnose it. The dark orange shows LGV patients that were already known as HIV+ and some, who were diagnosed at the same time, were HIV- (just a minor group of LGV cases - look at column 2010, ed). Fig. 34 For chlamydia, in 2016 we found more than 500 cases, mostly young women and a lot of heterosexual transmission and 1/5 of cases were completely asymptomatic (chlamydia was just discovered as a part of the global screening).  Fig. 35  CASES OF ACUTE HEPATITIS A  A table summarizing all the infections which can be transmitted by sexual intercourse will be shown later; in the meantime, bear in mind that HAV is one of those. We thought that HAV was only a foodborne infection but the habit of rimming i.e. the oral to anal intercourse, the so-called blackies3, increased a lot mostly in groups such as MSM and that is why we had such a steep increase in 2017-‘18-‘19 in Hepatitis A among young MSM. That is why we suggest vaccination for HAV in those patients. STIs cases can be represented as an iceberg in which the diagnosed cases are only the visible part i.e. the tip.  Diagnosed cases account for 10-20% of the real cases: the real STI numbers seem to be much higher because most of the cases are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, some of them are treated for a wrong diagnosis and others with self-treatment (that can actually decrease the number) e.g. if you think you have an STD, you go to your doctor but you don't want to tell him you have an STI, so you might say you have sore throat and fever and he will give you an antibiotic treatment which might decrease the symptoms, but hamper the evolution of the STI.  Fig. 36  COMORBIDITIES  The risk of acquiring HIV infection due to concomitant STDs increases exponentially. For some STDs it is pretty clear due to the presence of ulcerations: there is \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n20 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  damage in the mucosa, so there might be HIV transmission.  Some diseases as gonorrhoea and chlamydia don't directly present lesions on the mucosa but show inflammation which can be a route of HIV transmission: in this state there are a lot of white blood cells which can be either receptive for HIV and cause infection or can harbor HIV inside them and pass HIV to the partner.   STDS COMPLICATIONS  The majority of STDs complications are in women: most STDs are asymptomatic only in women and for this reason they are not diagnosed and treated. For example, chlamydia is mildly symptomatic in men, but it is absolutely asymptomatic in women.  In general STDs in women can cause infertility, chronic abdominal pain and pelvic inflammatory disease. During pregnancy, an STD can cause abortions, extrauterine pregnancy, newborn prematurity and infections, not only if it was contract right before pregnancy but also a few years before because of the chronic inflammatory modifications that occurred. Some STDs can have very serious complications, e.g. HPV is associated with cervical and anal cancer.   WHAT SHOULD BE THE FEATURES OF AN STDS CLINIC?  Until last year we had two different STD clinics in Turin: the Savoia hospital and the San Lazzaro dermatological hospital. Today we have a single STD clinic and the clinics should have some of these features:  ● Convenient opening hours4: opening hours should be flexible and available in order to allow certain populations to use the service;  ● Ask about the past medical history, sexual preference and risky behavior5: it is very important to ask the questions in a delicate and appropriate way and never be judgmental, otherwise we will not get the answers and we will not understand the risky behaviors;  ● Examinations should be performed including vaginal examination and withdrawing samples (some internal and some external);  ● Rapid smear (fresh and gram staining) is often enough to obtain the diagnosis. For example, fresh stain of Trichomonas (vaginalis, ed) and the fresh smear of (Neisseria, ed) gonorrhea or other bacteria and fungi are all successfully diagnostic;  ● Provide an immediate treatment either on the base of the smear or in presumptive way6 in order to reduce the risk of transmission during the following days;  ● Suggest partner notification and treatment in some STDs7;  ● The service must include counselling, prevention and follow up. In some diseases such as HIV also pre-exposure prophylaxis is fundamental.   Fig. 37  Aetiologies  Here is a table trying to summarize bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and ectoparasites that can cause STIs.  ● ●Bacteria:trachomatis  Chlamydia  especially and urethritis \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n21 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  Lymphogranuloma LGV), gonorrhoeae, pallidum  venereum, Neisseria Treponema (agent of syphilis) and Haemophilus ducreyi (agent of chancroid). There are other bacteria causing vaginitis (e.g. Gardnerella vaginalis). There are two Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma that usually are asymptomatic in the genital tract but may cause urinary inflammation;  ● Viruses: HPV, we know that can cause both condylomas, carcinomas and cancer. HSV2 will cause herpes genitalis, HIV will cause AIDS, HBV Hepatitis B, HAC, HCV8;  ● Fungi: we will see Candida even though the professor says it is hardly transmittable in the majority of subjects;  ● Protozoa: Trichomonas vaginalis - trichomoniasis;  ● Ectoparasites: Sarcoptes scabiei and Phthirus pubis.   18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 1 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIS)/DISEASES (STDS) GONORRHOEA- NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE Neisseria gonorrhea is a gram-negative diplococcus, very fragile in external environment. To grow in culture it needs specific means, it should be heated at 37° and kept in the heater, then examined and sent as soon as possible to the lab to preserve the culture.   - Incubation time is short, around few days (2-7); - Signs and symptoms: it is associated with purulent urethritis, cervicitis and proctitis which are characterized by whitish and yellowish secretions with pruritus and pain (for this reason patients usually seek medical advice); - Diagnosis is usually made with culture on urethral (PCR) and cervical swab; - Treatment: straightforward, usually ceftriaxone at very low dose (250mg) or ciprofloxacin single dose - up to 1 gram. This can be done at alternative regimen although nowadays there are increasing rates of resistance to ATB1 including fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone, all over the world but especially in the US and in Southeast Asia.  - It is important not only to trat the patient but to enforce the importance of notify the partner.   REITER'S SYNDROME  Also called reactive arthritis, mostly affecting large joints (especially lower limbs and knees) and it is asymmetrical. It might be associated with conjunctivitis and urethritis (sometimes gastroenteritis). It is associated with HLAB27+ genotype and it may present a few weeks after a gonococcal urethritis, but it is also associated with other bacteria, mainly gram-negative bacteria e.g. Shigella and Yersinia or Chlamydia as well.  CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS It is an obligate intracellular very small pathogen and there are different serovars divided in 3 classes:  A, B, C: causing trachoma, a conjunctivitis which can lead to blindness; C to K: aspecific urethritis (e.g. cervicitis, salpingitis, proctitis), in women PID i.e. pelvic inflammatory disease, and potentially infertility; L1 to L3: associated with Lymphogranuloma venereum, LGV. Diagnosis: PCR for Chlamydia DNA in urines; also a swab can be used but it is much easier to do it in urine.  Treatment is azithromycin 1gr single dose (doxycycline can also be used). The combination of ceftriaxone and azithromycin will cure both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Signs: aspecific urethritis, secretions, pruritus and pain when urinating. Male will usually seek medical advice while females will not as it is mostly asymptomatic in females, which is why usually transmission is mediated by woman.  Complication: Lymphogranuloma venereum is associated with L1-L3 serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis with an incubation period of 5-21 days. It is more common in tropical countries. It has 3 phases:  1 antibodies \nFigure 1 \nFigure 2 \nFigure 3 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 2 1. Chancroid, a non-painful ulcer, usually there is an inoculum of Chlamydia (remember: non-painful ulcers in genital area can be either LGV or syphilis); 2. After few days: painful satellite lymphadenitis with systemic symptoms (e.g. low-grade fever and malaise); 3. Chronic phase: acute proctitis/colitis with mucous purulent loss from anus, bloody stools, tenesmus, fever and pain. It is a hard DDX with IBDs due to similar signs and symptoms e.g. a lot of patients affected by LGV are wrongly diagnosed with RCU2.  3. SYPHILIS - TREPONEMA PALLIDUM It is not very easy to diagnose syphilis unless there are very clear signs and symptoms. The agent of syphilis is Treponema pallidum which is a motile gram-negative Spirochaeta. The disease has 3 well-defined stages:  1. Primary syphilis (where the inoculum is) is characterized by non-painful ulcers in the genital, sometime oral, areas. Typically, the genital ones affect penis and vagina, while the oral ulcers can be harder to detect. Anal ulcers are usually almost impossible to detect since they are not painful; 2. Secondary syphilis: it usually occurs 4-10 weeks after primary syphilis and is characterized by fever, malaise, there is an interesting rough maculopapular rash, non-confluent and non-itchy. It is reddish-brown (rusty color) and involves the palms of the hands and the bottom of the feet3. This rash is very typical as it is one of the few rashes involving these parts of the body, so if you see them, think of syphilis and don't touch these rashes as they are very contagious (as they are full of Treponema)4;  3. Tertiary syphilis: usually occurs if antibiotic treatment was not used in the previous phases, it occurs 10-15 years after the first infection. It is less common as antibiotics are more and more used in rich-resource countries. It occurs many years after infection and is characterized by granulomas (so called “syphilitic gummas”) that can be detected in several organs (CNS, liver, aorta and several others).  It may take between 10 to 30 years to develop from infection without any treatment due to the fact that antibiotic treatment somehow reduces the Treponema replication and the body reaction to inflammation (ed), consisting in the development of granulomas in the body tissues.       STAGES AND TIME FRAMES OF SYPHILIS  2 NdR2: RCU is the acronym in Italian for Rettocolite Ulcerosa, in English Ulcerative Colitis.  3 “you should remember it!” 4 Quote: \"and I don't think it's a funny way to get syphilis\" \nFigure 4 \nFigure 5 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 3  Figure 6 Complication: Neurosyphilis It is thought to be the direct invasion of the CNS by Treponema but it is much more common in HIV+ patients and so when we find HIV+ patients with titer against Treponema, we treat them more aggressively by performing a lumbar puncture in order to rule out neurosyphilis.  It may have a very different clinical presentation: most of the patients will be asymptomatic, others can present with aseptic meningitis. Neurosyphilis is an important consequence that we should rule out when we see someone with aseptic meningitis.  However, the chronic forms are very common, including:  Meningovascular Syphilis (vascular problems of the brain); General Paresis of Insane: it is a kind of paralytic dementia that mostly presents with psychiatric symptoms; Tabe Dorsalis: characterized by nerve root pain, sensory ataxia and often ocular involvement.  These complications are very rare (the professor never saw Tabe Dorsalis in his life, he only saw two or three cases of General Paresis) but it is important to know them and think of these complications in case of some dementia especially if you work in a psychiatric ward or in a neurologic ward. Be aware of these possibilities and eventually test for syphilis.  Diagnosis:  To diagnose syphilis, the usual screening test is Treponema immunoglobulin (IgG), if it is positive, the laboratory usually will directly run a Non Treponemal test (VDRL)5 and a Treponemal test (TPHA)6. With the combination of these three tests we are able to estimate the stage of infection. VDRL tells us the activity of the disease, and the VDRL titer should be followed over time to see if the therapy is effective or if maybe patients have been reinfected (especially in cases of immunosuppression).  After treatment, some patients will show a decrease in VDRL, then after reinfection they will show a new increase in VDRL and, every time, they will be exposed to new complications. If we have a primary or secondary syphilis, we can perform a test of direct evidence by swabbing lesions and analyzing them in dark field microscopy (not so many labs have this) or PCR i.e. detection of Treponema DNA on these lesions is one of the way of demonstrating the presence of Treponema. Mostly in primary syphilis the serology is not that useful while direct PCR test is.    5 Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test 6 Treponema pallidum Haemagglutination Assay \n18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 4 Treatment:  Usually Benzatil-Penicillin7 (2.4 millions of units) administered intramuscularly: 1 dose for primary syphilis and 3 doses for secondary syphilis (in this case doses are one week apart). This treatment is very painful (patient won’t like you) and for this reason we also inject Lidocaine to reduce the muscle pain. Alternatively, we can use Ceftriaxone or Doxycycline.  Bear in mind that in secondary syphilis there could be the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction which is an allergy to penicillin, it is the massive destruction of Treponema, so when we have a secondary syphilis, before the administration of penicillin, we should give a test dose of Amoxicillin and see if patient develops rash, hypotension or malaise, which are the typical signs of Herxheimer reaction. We usually give lots of steroid and follow the patient to see the progression.  4. CHANCROID - HAEMOPHILUS DUCREYI It is really common in tropical areas, but you might also see it in Europe, even though it is uncommon.  \"Chancroid\" is the US way of describing \"Ulcera molle\", which are ulcers in genital areas (fig.10).  The agent is Haemophilus ducreyi whose incubation period is 3-5 days. Vesicles open in a chancroid (soft painful ulceration with basal exudate), which is more similar to herpes.  N.B. remember painful ulcers in genital areas! We rely on clinical diagnosis as the sore is very hard to turn positive even with an appropriate lab technique. Treatment is ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin or azithromycin; the same treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae will work for this STI.  5. HERPES GENITALIS It is usually associated with HSV2 (some cases HSV1) and patients present with highly painful ulcerations in genital areas, preceded by pain and paresthesias, sometimes also dysuria, leukorrhea and itch in genital areas.  Clinical presentation is very similar to HSV1 (Herpes labialis), just in different regions. It is often recurrent (in more than 80% cases):  it can come back every month and last for 7-10 days, the quality of life will be highly affected as you will have excruciating pain for 10/30 days and you cannot have sexual intercourse because it is painful and there’s risk of contagion. For this reason, it will be a cause of distress for several patients which will lead them to search for medical treatment.  Diagnosis: typically clinical, based on history and clinical presentation. There is also serological diagnosis, which is specific for HSV2 and it could help to rule it out by assessing the presence of antibodies against HSV2 or run PCR by swabbing on this ulceration and looking for HSV2 and HSV1 DNA. Treatment: Acyclovir or Valacyclovir (in pills), in case of frequent recurrences we may use suppressive treatment for a few months ( usually 6)  to reduce relapses and improve the patient quality of life of the patient.   7 “so it is Depo Penicillin”  \nFigure 7 \nFigure 8 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 5 6. TRICHOMONIASIS - TRICHOMONAS VAGINALIS Agent of Trichomoniasis is Trichomonas vaginalis which is a very mobile protozoon, it has a short-medium incubation period 4-28 days. It usually causes very few symptoms:  in females: vaginitis with itch, dysuria, leukorrhea, dyspareunia. The discharged are characterized by a fishy odor, so usually the smell is bad, which is one of the reasons why many patients seek medical advice; in males: usually asymptomatic urethritis. Diagnosis is made on fresh smear obtained by swabbing the vaginal fluid and looking at fresh staining under the microscope. Under the microscope we can recognize the moving Trichomonas (fig.7). Diagnosis can be also clinical due to the presence of liquid leukorrhea with typical fishy odor, but it has to be followed by smear examination. Also PCR can be done after collecting urine8. Treatment: Metronidazole 2 gr single dose (normally a combination of pills in a single dose) to the patient and his/her partner. During this period alcohol should be avoided as it will interfere with metronidazole giving GI reactions.  Incidence of Trichomonas vaginalis (infection, ed) is raising over time.  The Trichomonas vaginalis is visible under microscope: the fresh smear with the protozoa moving around can be seen.   7. GENITAL CANDIDIASIS Candida is a commensal yeast which can be found in the skin, mouth, gut, vaginal flora. However, there are some predisposing conditions in which Candida will overgrow: diabetes, immune depression, microbiota alterations with reduced lactobacilli (antibiotics, mucositis, altered pH). It can be potentially transmittable, but it is very uncommon; in fact, when you analyze genetic strains in partners, 99% of the time the strains are different (only specific for the partner). Just a minority is found to be transmittable. We don't believe it is a contagious disease and for this reason we don't treat the partner in case of vaginal candidiasis. Clinical presentation: itchy vulvovaginitis with whitish leukorrhea (“cottage cheese”) due to the fact that it is more firm compared to Trichomonas (the aspect is cheesy). It can cause balanoposthitis with erythematous papules in men, but it is very uncommon as usually men don't have symptoms at all. Diagnosis is mostly clinical. We might also perform an exudate culture, usually in patients that have recurrences, in order to rule out a resistance to fluconazole, which is one of the most used antifungal agents in this setting. Treatment is usually local with ovules (clotrimazole, miconazole) or oral in severe cases (fluconazole, itraconazole). In case of frequent recurrences, suppressive therapy may be used to reduce the relapses which are usually associated with perimenstrual9 period due to changes in pH and flora, for which Candida can  8 Taken from slide 36 of 2019 9 NdR2: He said “premenopausal”; however, I believe it should be perimenstrual. Indeed, hormonal fluctuations before the menstrual cycle can trigger changes in the bacteria in the vagina and  high levels of estrogen cause Candida fungi to overgrow. Moreover, later he says “they have Candida in the days before menstruation”. NCBI: “daily colonization of Candida during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is described (...) \nFigure 9 \nFigure 10 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 6 replicate faster and become the predominant species in vagina. Most of patients indeed will tell you that they have Candida in the days before menstruation.  8. CONDYLOMAS   HPV10 causes Condylomata Acuminata, commonly known as genital warts. Remember the difference with Condyloma Lata that are wart-like lesions caused by syphilis: secondary syphilis that instead of having a diffuse rash, presents with localized papules that look like condylomas but are syphilomas. Condylomas are most frequently associated with HPV serotypes 6 and 11. They can be external (genital areas, trunk) or internal condylomas.  Diagnosis is usually clinical. Treatment11 varies according to number of warts and their localization. It can be: Removal (surgery, cryotherapy, cauterization); Topical therapy (purified podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, sinecatechin) to reduce the dimension of the external warts and “make them fall off”; The vaccine specific for these serotypes could reduce the incidence of condylomas over time.  9. ECTOPARASITES   They are included in this lesson as they can be transmitted by sexual intercourse or by close contact with other people.   Some of these insects are: - Lice: Pediculus humanus and Phthirus pubis; - Flies, Bedbugs and Fleas are very common in certain areas. They normally don't directly cause diseases (even if potentially they can) but they can cause lesions that need to be differentiated from infectious lesions; - Mites can cause diseases, especially Sarcoptes scabiei (the itch mite) which is the agent of scabies. \n demonstrating an increase in the colony count preceding symptom development”. 10 will be discussed shortly since it will be a topic of both Oncology and Gynecology courses. 11 it will probably be discussed also in the Dermatology course. \nFigure 11 \nFigure 12 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 7  Figure 13 9A. LICE It is important for you to have an idea of the difference between head lice, body lice and pubic lice in terms of agents, symptoms. They can be visible as the adult insect or more commonly as nits (more visible than lice). Symptoms are similar and affect certain areas: they can cause discoloration of the skin, chronic itching, psychological problems but globally itch is the major symptom.  - Head lice: Pediculus humanus capitis (2-3 mm long) - Body lice: Pediculus humanus humanus (2.3-3.6 mm long) - Pubic lice (crabs):  Phthirus pubis (1.1-1.8 mm long)12 Head lice found anywhere on the head (typically hair, but also can be found on the eyebrows). Body lice: typically found on the clothing, except when they need a blood meal. They then move to the skin (but usually found on the clothing NOT the skin). Pubic lice: usually found in pubic hair but are adapted to any other type of coarse hair (armpit region etc.) All of the lice types are six-legged. Differ on the basis of morphology (see pictures, especially pubic lice), where they can be found and size.  three types of lice13: - They are ectoparasites, they live on the surface of the host, as opposed to inside the body (endoparasite) as with many other parasites we’ve seen. Do need blood meals to survive; - Move by crawling, as opposed to flying or hopping, which affects the control and prevention measures needed; - Feet are specifically adapted to human hair (cannot survive for that long if they fall off a human.) They can only live 1-2 days if they fall off of a human host; - Have humans as their only host species, there is no animal reservoir, which makes control measures different and potentially simpler than other parasites;  12 from slide 45 13 Starting here until the end of paragraph “Epidemiology & risk factors” the information has been taken from the slides and notes professor made at the bottom. \nFigure 14 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 8 - Have similar life cycles:  o Egg/nit: usually located no more than 1/4 inches from the base of the human hair scalp. It's attached by a sticky glue-like substance secreted by the adult louse, which is what allows it to stick to the human hair. Takes 8-9 days to hatch; o Nymph (3 molts): There are three molting stages. Takes the nymphs approximately one week in total to move into the adult stage. The nymphs must take a blood meal in order to move on the next molting stage (therefore need three blood meals in total); o Adult: Can live up to 30 days on the human host. Die within 1-2 days without the human host. All adult lice need a blood meal in order to survive (nutrients). Females need it in particular for oviposition. Both nymphs and adults take blood meals from the human host. Symptoms of HEAD and PUBIC lice: - Itching: mostly due to the lice biting (people are somewhat allergic to the bite); - Difficulty Sleeping: this is due to vector biology - the lice are more active at night, so biting and itching are more likely to occur at night; - Sores and secondary bacterial infections from scratching: caused by scratching the itchy bites (and bacteria that's on the fingers or on the scalp can get into the bite). This is a minor symptom and isn't observed as often as the common itching! Symptoms of BODY lice: - Intense itching: more than head lice usually because there are more lice; - Skin discoloration/thickening: if infection is ongoing for a long period time (lots of lice bites), there can be skin discoloration and thickening in the areas with lots of bites. - Red rash appears where the lice have bitten; - Secondary bacterial infections from prolonged scratching: as with head lice, open wound → bacteria can enter from hands or surrounding skin area. Diagnosis is based on direct visualization, i.e. observation of live nymphs or adult lice, made easier by using a fine-teeth comb and magnifying glass. Finding nits is suggestive of infection but not definitive.  Nits are very small, and it is difficult to correctly identify them. They are often mistaken for other things in the hair: dandruff, droplets of hairspray, etc. Old nits can persist in the hair for a long time after infection (due to the sticky substance holding them to hair), so finding these old nits only indicates an old infection. Not necessarily an active infection that is still ongoing. Lice are small, quick, and avoid the light (are most active at night). In body lice, because lice are not normally found on the skin, you should look for them on the clothing. They can typically be found in the seams (along with nits)  EPIDEMIOLOGY & RISK FACTORS - Head lice: “head-to-head transmission” since lice do not live very long without a human host and are not adapted to walking along smooth surfaces that do not have human hair. They are found worldwide, causes 6-12 million cases per year in the United States in children age 3-11. Typically occurs more often with children and in schools and is not associated with poor hygiene. Girls are at higher risk than boys, probably because of more social contact, playing with hair, etc. African American subjects are less affected than other groups because lice are specifically adapted to clinging the best to certain types of human hair; 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 9 - Pubic lice: worldwide prevalence estimated of 2%, it can spread through sexual contact and fomites (clothing, linens, towels belonging to an infected person. If found on children, pubic lice can be an indicator of sexual abuse; - Body lice: associated with poor hygiene and crowded living conditions ex. prisons, homeless transient populations Remember that body lice can transmit several bugs. Following a few “historical” examples: - Louse Borne Relapsing Fever (caused by Borrelia recurrentis): there were several cases in migrants kept prisoners in Libya and through their journey to Italy. 14High case-fatality (10%) in WWII; mortality is 30-70% without treatment. It is more severe than the tick-borne version. Often found in epidemics amid poor-living conditions (and in war, like WWII) -- developing world. Spread when an uninfected human crushes an infected louse. B. recurrentis is spread via mucous membranes and then invades bloodstream. There is no animal reservoir and can alter the protein surface (causes relapses \"relapsing fever\"); - Trench Fever (caused by Bartonella quintana) during WWI. It is rarely fatal with serious symptoms e.g. acute fever onset (five days), headache, myalgias, rashes, splenomegaly (less common); - Epidemic Typhus (caused by Rickettsia prowazekii): significant contributor to worldwide mortality (millions) before antibiotic treatment. It is classified as a category B bioterrorism agent (second most severe category) i.e. moderately easy to disseminate. If you find body lice, it is important to check also for these diseases, since some of these are being observed in certain areas of the world (limited resources-countries) in the setting of humanitarian problems and incarceration. Lice Treatment15 ● If only nits are visible (no nymphs or adult lice) probably the infection is not active and treatment may not be necessary, however it is suggested because lice nits are not easy to recognize. This treatment consist in topical pediculicides (there is resistance concern over the world): pyrethroids are the most used ones, in particular permethrin at 1% concentration, to be applied at day 0 and a second round 7-10 days, even 14, after;  ● In case body lice is present a higher (5%) concentration is preferred, since the insect seems to be more resistant. A higher concentration is applied and left on for a few hours after application;  ● Oral ivermectin is another option for lice in case topical treatments cannot be used. It was first used against onchocerciasis16, but is also the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis17 and is effective against scabies. 9B. SCABIES - SARCOPTES SCABIEI Prevalence of scabies is estimated to be high all over the world (at 100 million people), with however a high variability (0.2-71%), the highest rates are in limited resources settings and in Pacific and Latin American countries. It is also more common in crowded conditions, for example it can cause epidemics in long-term care facilities and prisons. Every time there is a case in the emergency room, panic breaks out. It’s not really that highly contagious: you need to be in contact for some time with the skin of someone who has it to get  14  Information in italics in this paragraph is taken from Professor’s notes on powerpoint presentation 15 “I think it is very common. Before losing my hair, when I was a child, I have been treated at least 5-6 times for hair lice” -cit 16 From sbobinatore: Onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. 17 From sbobinatore: Strongyloidiasis is a chronic parasitic infection of humans caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. \nFigure 15 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 10 it. However, it can cause small epidemics and can be slightly contagious. The pathogen is Sarcoptes scabiei, an 8-legged mite. The females burrow into the epidermis after mating, and lay 2-3 eggs/day, but die after a few weeks. Larvae hatch in 3-4 days and as adults they can cause new rounds of infections and lesions. Usually there’s a low parasitic burden, so 10-15 per host. However, in the crusted scabies, also called Norwegian scabies, that occurs in an immunosuppressed host, there can be millions of mites, and that’s why it’s more serious, harder to treat, and more contagious. The mites die if they’re laid out of the body for a few hours: they need to be in contact with the host body for optimal temperature and nutrition. Transmission is based on prolonged skin-to-skin contact, fomites are usually uncommon but important for crusted scabies and animals do not transmit the mites.  CLASSIC SCABIES 3-6 weeks after infestation, classic scabies begins. There’s a severe pruritus everywhere on the body that worsens at night. There might also be an hypersensitivity reaction to mites, feces or eggs: patients might have not only the typical lesions caused by mites, but also an allergic reaction to mites’ components throughout the body. The lesions are multiple, small, erythematous papules, often excoriated. You might see burrows, even if they are not easy to see. They are thin serpiginous lines of different colors and are diagnostically significant. In these pictures you can see an inflammatory reaction (left) and a burrow (right)     In fig.17, the most common places where you can find scabies lesions are in red, while the less common are in green, like the back and the head.  Remember to take a look between fingers and on the knees i.e. the two most common locations for scabies lesions.       CRUSTED SCABIES (NORWEGIAN SCABIES)  It is the disease in immunosuppressed hosts, especially those with AIDS, lymphoma, or on chronic corticosteroids treatment. They have a very high mite burden, with less defined lesions resembling erythematous squamous patches that develop scales over them, as well as crusts, warts, fissures and they may smell badly because of underlying infection.  Complications: these lesions may complicate mostly with superinfections, usually from staphylococci or streptococci, that may cause impetigo, ecthyma, paronychia and furunculosis, potentially also \nFigure 16 \nFigure 17 \nFigure 18 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 11 sepsis because of dissemination of gram-positive bacteria in all of the body through blood. Diagnosis is usually clinical, according to presentation and risk factors. Skin scraping may help identifying mites at microscopical evaluation, but dermoscopy can also be used.  Treatment: Topical Permethrin massaged over the skin and removed some hours afterwards and repeated 7 days after. Efficacy is 90%, and in case of somebody in contact with an infected patient it can also be used as prophylaxis; Oral ivermectin also seems to be effective, it is given as a single dose of 200 micrograms/Kg, repeated 7 days after. Efficacy is again >90%. It cannot be given to pregnant/lactating women or children under 15 Kg; Older treatments: benzoyl-benzoate, topical sulfur, less used nowadays because of adverse skin reactions; Crusted scabies is treated with topical permethrin at higher dose, applied every day for 7 days, then twice weekly until cured (much longer treatment) and it’s suggested in combination with oral ivermectin on days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15. It’s much more difficult to treat and eradicate.  PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) In Italy it has been promoted and used mostly in STD clinics as part of a prevention package. Nowadays infection specialists can write down a prescription for PrEP, the patient buys it in the pharmacy. There’s no reimbursement so they have to pay for the drugs entirely18, oppositely to other countries (ex. France) in which if you are at risk of contracting HIV, you’re under an STD clinic care and you receive the drugs for free. It has been demonstrated that it’s cost-effective to prevent rather than treat these diseases once people at high risk get infected. Remember two things: - among new HIV infections outside sub-Saharan Africa, you have 20-25% of cases, or 30% in certain settings, discovered in MSM; therefore, MSM are one of the key groups in which you might have a high incidence of HIV infection;  - once you identify someone who has an STD, whatever it is, understand that he has a very high risk of contracting another STD, because of risky behaviors, because of no usage of condoms, because of the lesions that may increase the risk of getting HIV. \n 18 nowadays they are generics, so the cost is lower, but still the drug is paid entirely by the patient \nFigure 19 \nFigure 20 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 12  This study shows that patients diagnosed with syphilis had a super high risk of getting HIV in the two years after the first diagnosis. Those HIV diagnoses could have been prevented with counseling plus whatever intervention. So, they should include pre-exposure prophylaxis, because we know it’s 90% effective in preventing HIV.  However, HIV prevention should be a combination of strategies, also because we know that just giving a magic pill is not a solution. Patients starting pre-exposure prophylaxis may have a slight increase in the risk of getting other STDs, probably because some people feel protected from HIV, so condom usage is slightly lower. In some studies, there was no effect, in some others a slight reduction in the use of condoms has been observed, so there was a higher incidence of other STDs. HIV prevention is a combination of different things: subject that receives PrEP should also do counseling, scheduled visits for follow up, prevent other STDs etc.    Globally, taken outside the STD clinic, PrEP is a combination of: - Risk reduction: condoms, syringe, methadone injection programs; - Early diagnosis: in certain countries we have self-tests, oral tests for HIV that people can take and, if it’s positive, there’s a number to call to book an appointment and be followed by an HIV clinic; - Test and treat: means that if I discover that someone has HIV I try to treat him as soon as possible, in order to reduce ongoing transmission; - Unfortunately, the vaccine is still on its way; - PMTCT: means prevention of mother to child transmission, because it’s a very effective way to reduce numbers of new HIV positive patients; - PEP: if there’s a risk, post-exposure prophylaxis might work; - PREP: it’s just one piece of the puzzle; - Male circumcision: it has been used in several low-resources countries in the last 20 years, with a reduction in the risk of getting HIV of 50-60%. Again, combining all these interventions, we can reduce the incidence of HIV and probably get rid of it in a few years. There are several approaches to pre-exposure prophylaxis, some are topical, which is very important because in certain settings women may not be able to discuss about safe sex, so it’s something they can just provide for themselves without having to discuss it with partners. An example is Tenofovir gel that has been associated with reduction of HIV contraction. There’s a vaginal ring dapivirine that has not been developed for treatment but only for prevention.  Most of the treatments are oral combinations of drugs: Tenofovir and Emtricitabine are two nucleoside analogues inhibitors of reverse transcriptase used for therapy. Some people were already taking them as prophylaxis before going to parties19, and then randomized studies followed and demonstrated a very big  19 he cites types of parties: dark room parties. I swear this guy :’)  \nFigure 21 \nFigure 22 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 13 reduction in HIV risk. There are, still in phase 3, some drugs given intramuscular or subcutaneously every 2-3 months and they persist for a long time in blood and may prevent HIV transmission by inhibiting the virus in the vaginal, anal, oral mucosa (all mucosae that might be infected by HIV).  PREP CLINICAL TRIALS These are all the clinical trials suggesting reduction in the risk of HIV in different populations.  Those in red have been discontinued because of no effect and they were mostly performed on heterosexual women. The effectiveness of this strategy on women seems to be lower. There’s probably one pharmacologically related reason: the concentrations that these drugs reach in the vagina are much lower compared to those reached in the anus, so the protection is much lower.  There’s also need for high adherence to the clinical trial. Professor: “you are not sick, it is a prevention and so adherence has been shown to be poor in certain settings”.  Possible interpretation: heterosexual women are not affected by HIV and since this is just a prevention trial (and there might be less compliance to it), the response has been shown to be poor in certain settings, probably due to the fact that less people were adhering to the clinical trial compared to MSM.  The likely explanation for the reduced effect in PrEP CT in heterosexual women might be both the reduced effect of the drug and the reduced adherence to the CT. On the other hand, in MSM the reduction in new infection was approximately 90%, hence very effective. At the moment, there are two strategies that we can prescribe to patients if they fall in a higher risk profile (according to scores): 1. Patients take one pill once a day of tenofovir and emtricitabine called Truvada; 2. The second is an “on demand” or event-driven pre-exposure prophylaxis for patients that concentrate the number of partners in the weekends. Two pills should be taken 2-24 hours before sex20, 1 pill 24 hours later and 1 pill 48 hours after first intake. Both methods seem to be equally effective.  BARRIERS TO PREP Many colleagues consider this strategy wrong in terms of ethical considerations, but the professor says he doesn’t understand because we’re talking about risk reduction, not about what is better or worse. We are trying to reduce the risk of getting a chronic disease that is potentially deadly and costly to treat - it is also pragmatic. It’s not the only intervention, it should be seen as part of a package intervention, however ethical issues here are nonsense21. If you were to ask which are the most important barriers to pre-exposure prophylaxis in Europe, these are:  20 NdR2: aridaje con ‘sto dark room party: “to a dark room thing, to an event where they know something is going to happen” 21 We love you Calcagno even if we can’t see you \nFigure 23 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 14 the cost is one of the most important, because patients must pay for drugs. Now the cost is 30-40 euros per month (drugs are generic); the feasibility; the risk of increasing other STIs; the lower condom use. Most important ones: cost and potential compensation risk for other STIs.    PREP AT DEAN STREET, LONDON Dean Street is an STD clinic in London in which patients can present at every hour, they have counseling, psychological services, they can do swabs for diagnosis and also deal with cum sex problems. Cum sex is something growing in several cities in Europe and in the US and it increases the risk of contracting HIV at a very high level but also causes psychological problems, it’s something that should be taken care of because of sexual health but also psychological health consequences.  In Dean Street PrEP has been used for a long time, the black line in this graph (fig.13) is the number of tests per month: they test almost 6000 subjects per month, and the dotted line is the number of positive tests; there’s no reduction in the number of HIV testing but there’s a steep reduction in the number of HIV diagnosis. This is because PrEP and preventive counseling are used.    In fig.25 there is a comparison between three different clinics in the UK, where only one uses PrEP, while the other two don’t. HIV incidence is going down only in the clinic that uses PrEP. To conclude, it’s part of the task of STD clinics to counsel and prevent STIs but also HIV, and PrEP is one small piece of this puzzle.    \nFigure 24 \nFigure 25 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 1 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIS)/DISEASES (STDS) GONORRHOEA- NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE Neisseria gonorrhea is a gram-negative diplococcus, very fragile in external environment. To grow in culture it needs specific means, it should be heated at 37° and kept in the heater, then examined and sent as soon as possible to the lab to preserve the culture.   - Incubation time is short, around few days (2-7); - Signs and symptoms: it is associated with purulent urethritis, cervicitis and proctitis which are characterized by whitish and yellowish secretions with pruritus and pain (for this reason patients usually seek medical advice); - Diagnosis is usually made with culture on urethral (PCR) and cervical swab; - Treatment: straightforward, usually ceftriaxone at very low dose (250mg) or ciprofloxacin single dose - up to 1 gram. This can be done at alternative regimen although nowadays there are increasing rates of resistance to ATB1 including fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone, all over the world but especially in the US and in Southeast Asia.  - It is important not only to trat the patient but to enforce the importance of notify the partner.   REITER'S SYNDROME  Also called reactive arthritis, mostly affecting large joints (especially lower limbs and knees) and it is asymmetrical. It might be associated with conjunctivitis and urethritis (sometimes gastroenteritis). It is associated with HLAB27+ genotype and it may present a few weeks after a gonococcal urethritis, but it is also associated with other bacteria, mainly gram-negative bacteria e.g. Shigella and Yersinia or Chlamydia as well.  CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS It is an obligate intracellular very small pathogen and there are different serovars divided in 3 classes:  A, B, C: causing trachoma, a conjunctivitis which can lead to blindness; C to K: aspecific urethritis (e.g. cervicitis, salpingitis, proctitis), in women PID i.e. pelvic inflammatory disease, and potentially infertility; L1 to L3: associated with Lymphogranuloma venereum, LGV. Diagnosis: PCR for Chlamydia DNA in urines; also a swab can be used but it is much easier to do it in urine.  Treatment is azithromycin 1gr single dose (doxycycline can also be used). The combination of ceftriaxone and azithromycin will cure both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Signs: aspecific urethritis, secretions, pruritus and pain when urinating. Male will usually seek medical advice while females will not as it is mostly asymptomatic in females, which is why usually transmission is mediated by woman.  Complication: Lymphogranuloma venereum is associated with L1-L3 serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis with an incubation period of 5-21 days. It is more common in tropical countries. It has 3 phases:  1 antibodies \nFigure 1 \nFigure 2 \nFigure 3 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 2 1. Chancroid, a non-painful ulcer, usually there is an inoculum of Chlamydia (remember: non-painful ulcers in genital area can be either LGV or syphilis); 2. After few days: painful satellite lymphadenitis with systemic symptoms (e.g. low-grade fever and malaise); 3. Chronic phase: acute proctitis/colitis with mucous purulent loss from anus, bloody stools, tenesmus, fever and pain. It is a hard DDX with IBDs due to similar signs and symptoms e.g. a lot of patients affected by LGV are wrongly diagnosed with RCU2.  3. SYPHILIS - TREPONEMA PALLIDUM It is not very easy to diagnose syphilis unless there are very clear signs and symptoms. The agent of syphilis is Treponema pallidum which is a motile gram-negative Spirochaeta. The disease has 3 well-defined stages:  1. Primary syphilis (where the inoculum is) is characterized by non-painful ulcers in the genital, sometime oral, areas. Typically, the genital ones affect penis and vagina, while the oral ulcers can be harder to detect. Anal ulcers are usually almost impossible to detect since they are not painful; 2. Secondary syphilis: it usually occurs 4-10 weeks after primary syphilis and is characterized by fever, malaise, there is an interesting rough maculopapular rash, non-confluent and non-itchy. It is reddish-brown (rusty color) and involves the palms of the hands and the bottom of the feet3. This rash is very typical as it is one of the few rashes involving these parts of the body, so if you see them, think of syphilis and don't touch these rashes as they are very contagious (as they are full of Treponema)4;  3. Tertiary syphilis: usually occurs if antibiotic treatment was not used in the previous phases, it occurs 10-15 years after the first infection. It is less common as antibiotics are more and more used in rich-resource countries. It occurs many years after infection and is characterized by granulomas (so called “syphilitic gummas”) that can be detected in several organs (CNS, liver, aorta and several others).  It may take between 10 to 30 years to develop from infection without any treatment due to the fact that antibiotic treatment somehow reduces the Treponema replication and the body reaction to inflammation (ed), consisting in the development of granulomas in the body tissues.       STAGES AND TIME FRAMES OF SYPHILIS  2 NdR2: RCU is the acronym in Italian for Rettocolite Ulcerosa, in English Ulcerative Colitis.  3 “you should remember it!” 4 Quote: \"and I don't think it's a funny way to get syphilis\" \nFigure 4 \nFigure 5 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 3  Figure 6 Complication: Neurosyphilis It is thought to be the direct invasion of the CNS by Treponema but it is much more common in HIV+ patients and so when we find HIV+ patients with titer against Treponema, we treat them more aggressively by performing a lumbar puncture in order to rule out neurosyphilis.  It may have a very different clinical presentation: most of the patients will be asymptomatic, others can present with aseptic meningitis. Neurosyphilis is an important consequence that we should rule out when we see someone with aseptic meningitis.  However, the chronic forms are very common, including:  Meningovascular Syphilis (vascular problems of the brain); General Paresis of Insane: it is a kind of paralytic dementia that mostly presents with psychiatric symptoms; Tabe Dorsalis: characterized by nerve root pain, sensory ataxia and often ocular involvement.  These complications are very rare (the professor never saw Tabe Dorsalis in his life, he only saw two or three cases of General Paresis) but it is important to know them and think of these complications in case of some dementia especially if you work in a psychiatric ward or in a neurologic ward. Be aware of these possibilities and eventually test for syphilis.  Diagnosis:  To diagnose syphilis, the usual screening test is Treponema immunoglobulin (IgG), if it is positive, the laboratory usually will directly run a Non Treponemal test (VDRL)5 and a Treponemal test (TPHA)6. With the combination of these three tests we are able to estimate the stage of infection. VDRL tells us the activity of the disease, and the VDRL titer should be followed over time to see if the therapy is effective or if maybe patients have been reinfected (especially in cases of immunosuppression).  After treatment, some patients will show a decrease in VDRL, then after reinfection they will show a new increase in VDRL and, every time, they will be exposed to new complications. If we have a primary or secondary syphilis, we can perform a test of direct evidence by swabbing lesions and analyzing them in dark field microscopy (not so many labs have this) or PCR i.e. detection of Treponema DNA on these lesions is one of the way of demonstrating the presence of Treponema. Mostly in primary syphilis the serology is not that useful while direct PCR test is.    5 Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test 6 Treponema pallidum Haemagglutination Assay \n18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 4 Treatment:  Usually Benzatil-Penicillin7 (2.4 millions of units) administered intramuscularly: 1 dose for primary syphilis and 3 doses for secondary syphilis (in this case doses are one week apart). This treatment is very painful (patient won’t like you) and for this reason we also inject Lidocaine to reduce the muscle pain. Alternatively, we can use Ceftriaxone or Doxycycline.  Bear in mind that in secondary syphilis there could be the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction which is an allergy to penicillin, it is the massive destruction of Treponema, so when we have a secondary syphilis, before the administration of penicillin, we should give a test dose of Amoxicillin and see if patient develops rash, hypotension or malaise, which are the typical signs of Herxheimer reaction. We usually give lots of steroid and follow the patient to see the progression.  4. CHANCROID - HAEMOPHILUS DUCREYI It is really common in tropical areas, but you might also see it in Europe, even though it is uncommon.  \"Chancroid\" is the US way of describing \"Ulcera molle\", which are ulcers in genital areas (fig.10).  The agent is Haemophilus ducreyi whose incubation period is 3-5 days. Vesicles open in a chancroid (soft painful ulceration with basal exudate), which is more similar to herpes.  N.B. remember painful ulcers in genital areas! We rely on clinical diagnosis as the sore is very hard to turn positive even with an appropriate lab technique. Treatment is ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin or azithromycin; the same treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae will work for this STI.  5. HERPES GENITALIS It is usually associated with HSV2 (some cases HSV1) and patients present with highly painful ulcerations in genital areas, preceded by pain and paresthesias, sometimes also dysuria, leukorrhea and itch in genital areas.  Clinical presentation is very similar to HSV1 (Herpes labialis), just in different regions. It is often recurrent (in more than 80% cases):  it can come back every month and last for 7-10 days, the quality of life will be highly affected as you will have excruciating pain for 10/30 days and you cannot have sexual intercourse because it is painful and there’s risk of contagion. For this reason, it will be a cause of distress for several patients which will lead them to search for medical treatment.  Diagnosis: typically clinical, based on history and clinical presentation. There is also serological diagnosis, which is specific for HSV2 and it could help to rule it out by assessing the presence of antibodies against HSV2 or run PCR by swabbing on this ulceration and looking for HSV2 and HSV1 DNA. Treatment: Acyclovir or Valacyclovir (in pills), in case of frequent recurrences we may use suppressive treatment for a few months ( usually 6)  to reduce relapses and improve the patient quality of life of the patient.   7 “so it is Depo Penicillin”  \nFigure 7 \nFigure 8 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 5 6. TRICHOMONIASIS - TRICHOMONAS VAGINALIS Agent of Trichomoniasis is Trichomonas vaginalis which is a very mobile protozoon, it has a short-medium incubation period 4-28 days. It usually causes very few symptoms:  in females: vaginitis with itch, dysuria, leukorrhea, dyspareunia. The discharged are characterized by a fishy odor, so usually the smell is bad, which is one of the reasons why many patients seek medical advice; in males: usually asymptomatic urethritis. Diagnosis is made on fresh smear obtained by swabbing the vaginal fluid and looking at fresh staining under the microscope. Under the microscope we can recognize the moving Trichomonas (fig.7). Diagnosis can be also clinical due to the presence of liquid leukorrhea with typical fishy odor, but it has to be followed by smear examination. Also PCR can be done after collecting urine8. Treatment: Metronidazole 2 gr single dose (normally a combination of pills in a single dose) to the patient and his/her partner. During this period alcohol should be avoided as it will interfere with metronidazole giving GI reactions.  Incidence of Trichomonas vaginalis (infection, ed) is raising over time.  The Trichomonas vaginalis is visible under microscope: the fresh smear with the protozoa moving around can be seen.   7. GENITAL CANDIDIASIS Candida is a commensal yeast which can be found in the skin, mouth, gut, vaginal flora. However, there are some predisposing conditions in which Candida will overgrow: diabetes, immune depression, microbiota alterations with reduced lactobacilli (antibiotics, mucositis, altered pH). It can be potentially transmittable, but it is very uncommon; in fact, when you analyze genetic strains in partners, 99% of the time the strains are different (only specific for the partner). Just a minority is found to be transmittable. We don't believe it is a contagious disease and for this reason we don't treat the partner in case of vaginal candidiasis. Clinical presentation: itchy vulvovaginitis with whitish leukorrhea (“cottage cheese”) due to the fact that it is more firm compared to Trichomonas (the aspect is cheesy). It can cause balanoposthitis with erythematous papules in men, but it is very uncommon as usually men don't have symptoms at all. Diagnosis is mostly clinical. We might also perform an exudate culture, usually in patients that have recurrences, in order to rule out a resistance to fluconazole, which is one of the most used antifungal agents in this setting. Treatment is usually local with ovules (clotrimazole, miconazole) or oral in severe cases (fluconazole, itraconazole). In case of frequent recurrences, suppressive therapy may be used to reduce the relapses which are usually associated with perimenstrual9 period due to changes in pH and flora, for which Candida can  8 Taken from slide 36 of 2019 9 NdR2: He said “premenopausal”; however, I believe it should be perimenstrual. Indeed, hormonal fluctuations before the menstrual cycle can trigger changes in the bacteria in the vagina and  high levels of estrogen cause Candida fungi to overgrow. Moreover, later he says “they have Candida in the days before menstruation”. NCBI: “daily colonization of Candida during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is described (...) \nFigure 9 \nFigure 10 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 6 replicate faster and become the predominant species in vagina. Most of patients indeed will tell you that they have Candida in the days before menstruation.  8. CONDYLOMAS   HPV10 causes Condylomata Acuminata, commonly known as genital warts. Remember the difference with Condyloma Lata that are wart-like lesions caused by syphilis: secondary syphilis that instead of having a diffuse rash, presents with localized papules that look like condylomas but are syphilomas. Condylomas are most frequently associated with HPV serotypes 6 and 11. They can be external (genital areas, trunk) or internal condylomas.  Diagnosis is usually clinical. Treatment11 varies according to number of warts and their localization. It can be: Removal (surgery, cryotherapy, cauterization); Topical therapy (purified podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, sinecatechin) to reduce the dimension of the external warts and “make them fall off”; The vaccine specific for these serotypes could reduce the incidence of condylomas over time.  9. ECTOPARASITES   They are included in this lesson as they can be transmitted by sexual intercourse or by close contact with other people.   Some of these insects are: - Lice: Pediculus humanus and Phthirus pubis; - Flies, Bedbugs and Fleas are very common in certain areas. They normally don't directly cause diseases (even if potentially they can) but they can cause lesions that need to be differentiated from infectious lesions; - Mites can cause diseases, especially Sarcoptes scabiei (the itch mite) which is the agent of scabies. \n demonstrating an increase in the colony count preceding symptom development”. 10 will be discussed shortly since it will be a topic of both Oncology and Gynecology courses. 11 it will probably be discussed also in the Dermatology course. \nFigure 11 \nFigure 12 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 7  Figure 13 9A. LICE It is important for you to have an idea of the difference between head lice, body lice and pubic lice in terms of agents, symptoms. They can be visible as the adult insect or more commonly as nits (more visible than lice). Symptoms are similar and affect certain areas: they can cause discoloration of the skin, chronic itching, psychological problems but globally itch is the major symptom.  - Head lice: Pediculus humanus capitis (2-3 mm long) - Body lice: Pediculus humanus humanus (2.3-3.6 mm long) - Pubic lice (crabs):  Phthirus pubis (1.1-1.8 mm long)12 Head lice found anywhere on the head (typically hair, but also can be found on the eyebrows). Body lice: typically found on the clothing, except when they need a blood meal. They then move to the skin (but usually found on the clothing NOT the skin). Pubic lice: usually found in pubic hair but are adapted to any other type of coarse hair (armpit region etc.) All of the lice types are six-legged. Differ on the basis of morphology (see pictures, especially pubic lice), where they can be found and size.  three types of lice13: - They are ectoparasites, they live on the surface of the host, as opposed to inside the body (endoparasite) as with many other parasites we’ve seen. Do need blood meals to survive; - Move by crawling, as opposed to flying or hopping, which affects the control and prevention measures needed; - Feet are specifically adapted to human hair (cannot survive for that long if they fall off a human.) They can only live 1-2 days if they fall off of a human host; - Have humans as their only host species, there is no animal reservoir, which makes control measures different and potentially simpler than other parasites;  12 from slide 45 13 Starting here until the end of paragraph “Epidemiology & risk factors” the information has been taken from the slides and notes professor made at the bottom. \nFigure 14 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 8 - Have similar life cycles:  o Egg/nit: usually located no more than 1/4 inches from the base of the human hair scalp. It's attached by a sticky glue-like substance secreted by the adult louse, which is what allows it to stick to the human hair. Takes 8-9 days to hatch; o Nymph (3 molts): There are three molting stages. Takes the nymphs approximately one week in total to move into the adult stage. The nymphs must take a blood meal in order to move on the next molting stage (therefore need three blood meals in total); o Adult: Can live up to 30 days on the human host. Die within 1-2 days without the human host. All adult lice need a blood meal in order to survive (nutrients). Females need it in particular for oviposition. Both nymphs and adults take blood meals from the human host. Symptoms of HEAD and PUBIC lice: - Itching: mostly due to the lice biting (people are somewhat allergic to the bite); - Difficulty Sleeping: this is due to vector biology - the lice are more active at night, so biting and itching are more likely to occur at night; - Sores and secondary bacterial infections from scratching: caused by scratching the itchy bites (and bacteria that's on the fingers or on the scalp can get into the bite). This is a minor symptom and isn't observed as often as the common itching! Symptoms of BODY lice: - Intense itching: more than head lice usually because there are more lice; - Skin discoloration/thickening: if infection is ongoing for a long period time (lots of lice bites), there can be skin discoloration and thickening in the areas with lots of bites. - Red rash appears where the lice have bitten; - Secondary bacterial infections from prolonged scratching: as with head lice, open wound → bacteria can enter from hands or surrounding skin area. Diagnosis is based on direct visualization, i.e. observation of live nymphs or adult lice, made easier by using a fine-teeth comb and magnifying glass. Finding nits is suggestive of infection but not definitive.  Nits are very small, and it is difficult to correctly identify them. They are often mistaken for other things in the hair: dandruff, droplets of hairspray, etc. Old nits can persist in the hair for a long time after infection (due to the sticky substance holding them to hair), so finding these old nits only indicates an old infection. Not necessarily an active infection that is still ongoing. Lice are small, quick, and avoid the light (are most active at night). In body lice, because lice are not normally found on the skin, you should look for them on the clothing. They can typically be found in the seams (along with nits)  EPIDEMIOLOGY & RISK FACTORS - Head lice: “head-to-head transmission” since lice do not live very long without a human host and are not adapted to walking along smooth surfaces that do not have human hair. They are found worldwide, causes 6-12 million cases per year in the United States in children age 3-11. Typically occurs more often with children and in schools and is not associated with poor hygiene. Girls are at higher risk than boys, probably because of more social contact, playing with hair, etc. African American subjects are less affected than other groups because lice are specifically adapted to clinging the best to certain types of human hair; 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 9 - Pubic lice: worldwide prevalence estimated of 2%, it can spread through sexual contact and fomites (clothing, linens, towels belonging to an infected person. If found on children, pubic lice can be an indicator of sexual abuse; - Body lice: associated with poor hygiene and crowded living conditions ex. prisons, homeless transient populations Remember that body lice can transmit several bugs. Following a few “historical” examples: - Louse Borne Relapsing Fever (caused by Borrelia recurrentis): there were several cases in migrants kept prisoners in Libya and through their journey to Italy. 14High case-fatality (10%) in WWII; mortality is 30-70% without treatment. It is more severe than the tick-borne version. Often found in epidemics amid poor-living conditions (and in war, like WWII) -- developing world. Spread when an uninfected human crushes an infected louse. B. recurrentis is spread via mucous membranes and then invades bloodstream. There is no animal reservoir and can alter the protein surface (causes relapses \"relapsing fever\"); - Trench Fever (caused by Bartonella quintana) during WWI. It is rarely fatal with serious symptoms e.g. acute fever onset (five days), headache, myalgias, rashes, splenomegaly (less common); - Epidemic Typhus (caused by Rickettsia prowazekii): significant contributor to worldwide mortality (millions) before antibiotic treatment. It is classified as a category B bioterrorism agent (second most severe category) i.e. moderately easy to disseminate. If you find body lice, it is important to check also for these diseases, since some of these are being observed in certain areas of the world (limited resources-countries) in the setting of humanitarian problems and incarceration. Lice Treatment15 ● If only nits are visible (no nymphs or adult lice) probably the infection is not active and treatment may not be necessary, however it is suggested because lice nits are not easy to recognize. This treatment consist in topical pediculicides (there is resistance concern over the world): pyrethroids are the most used ones, in particular permethrin at 1% concentration, to be applied at day 0 and a second round 7-10 days, even 14, after;  ● In case body lice is present a higher (5%) concentration is preferred, since the insect seems to be more resistant. A higher concentration is applied and left on for a few hours after application;  ● Oral ivermectin is another option for lice in case topical treatments cannot be used. It was first used against onchocerciasis16, but is also the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis17 and is effective against scabies. 9B. SCABIES - SARCOPTES SCABIEI Prevalence of scabies is estimated to be high all over the world (at 100 million people), with however a high variability (0.2-71%), the highest rates are in limited resources settings and in Pacific and Latin American countries. It is also more common in crowded conditions, for example it can cause epidemics in long-term care facilities and prisons. Every time there is a case in the emergency room, panic breaks out. It’s not really that highly contagious: you need to be in contact for some time with the skin of someone who has it to get  14  Information in italics in this paragraph is taken from Professor’s notes on powerpoint presentation 15 “I think it is very common. Before losing my hair, when I was a child, I have been treated at least 5-6 times for hair lice” -cit 16 From sbobinatore: Onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. 17 From sbobinatore: Strongyloidiasis is a chronic parasitic infection of humans caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. \nFigure 15 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 10 it. However, it can cause small epidemics and can be slightly contagious. The pathogen is Sarcoptes scabiei, an 8-legged mite. The females burrow into the epidermis after mating, and lay 2-3 eggs/day, but die after a few weeks. Larvae hatch in 3-4 days and as adults they can cause new rounds of infections and lesions. Usually there’s a low parasitic burden, so 10-15 per host. However, in the crusted scabies, also called Norwegian scabies, that occurs in an immunosuppressed host, there can be millions of mites, and that’s why it’s more serious, harder to treat, and more contagious. The mites die if they’re laid out of the body for a few hours: they need to be in contact with the host body for optimal temperature and nutrition. Transmission is based on prolonged skin-to-skin contact, fomites are usually uncommon but important for crusted scabies and animals do not transmit the mites.  CLASSIC SCABIES 3-6 weeks after infestation, classic scabies begins. There’s a severe pruritus everywhere on the body that worsens at night. There might also be an hypersensitivity reaction to mites, feces or eggs: patients might have not only the typical lesions caused by mites, but also an allergic reaction to mites’ components throughout the body. The lesions are multiple, small, erythematous papules, often excoriated. You might see burrows, even if they are not easy to see. They are thin serpiginous lines of different colors and are diagnostically significant. In these pictures you can see an inflammatory reaction (left) and a burrow (right)     In fig.17, the most common places where you can find scabies lesions are in red, while the less common are in green, like the back and the head.  Remember to take a look between fingers and on the knees i.e. the two most common locations for scabies lesions.       CRUSTED SCABIES (NORWEGIAN SCABIES)  It is the disease in immunosuppressed hosts, especially those with AIDS, lymphoma, or on chronic corticosteroids treatment. They have a very high mite burden, with less defined lesions resembling erythematous squamous patches that develop scales over them, as well as crusts, warts, fissures and they may smell badly because of underlying infection.  Complications: these lesions may complicate mostly with superinfections, usually from staphylococci or streptococci, that may cause impetigo, ecthyma, paronychia and furunculosis, potentially also \nFigure 16 \nFigure 17 \nFigure 18 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 11 sepsis because of dissemination of gram-positive bacteria in all of the body through blood. Diagnosis is usually clinical, according to presentation and risk factors. Skin scraping may help identifying mites at microscopical evaluation, but dermoscopy can also be used.  Treatment: Topical Permethrin massaged over the skin and removed some hours afterwards and repeated 7 days after. Efficacy is 90%, and in case of somebody in contact with an infected patient it can also be used as prophylaxis; Oral ivermectin also seems to be effective, it is given as a single dose of 200 micrograms/Kg, repeated 7 days after. Efficacy is again >90%. It cannot be given to pregnant/lactating women or children under 15 Kg; Older treatments: benzoyl-benzoate, topical sulfur, less used nowadays because of adverse skin reactions; Crusted scabies is treated with topical permethrin at higher dose, applied every day for 7 days, then twice weekly until cured (much longer treatment) and it’s suggested in combination with oral ivermectin on days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15. It’s much more difficult to treat and eradicate.  PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) In Italy it has been promoted and used mostly in STD clinics as part of a prevention package. Nowadays infection specialists can write down a prescription for PrEP, the patient buys it in the pharmacy. There’s no reimbursement so they have to pay for the drugs entirely18, oppositely to other countries (ex. France) in which if you are at risk of contracting HIV, you’re under an STD clinic care and you receive the drugs for free. It has been demonstrated that it’s cost-effective to prevent rather than treat these diseases once people at high risk get infected. Remember two things: - among new HIV infections outside sub-Saharan Africa, you have 20-25% of cases, or 30% in certain settings, discovered in MSM; therefore, MSM are one of the key groups in which you might have a high incidence of HIV infection;  - once you identify someone who has an STD, whatever it is, understand that he has a very high risk of contracting another STD, because of risky behaviors, because of no usage of condoms, because of the lesions that may increase the risk of getting HIV. \n 18 nowadays they are generics, so the cost is lower, but still the drug is paid entirely by the patient \nFigure 19 \nFigure 20 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 12  This study shows that patients diagnosed with syphilis had a super high risk of getting HIV in the two years after the first diagnosis. Those HIV diagnoses could have been prevented with counseling plus whatever intervention. So, they should include pre-exposure prophylaxis, because we know it’s 90% effective in preventing HIV.  However, HIV prevention should be a combination of strategies, also because we know that just giving a magic pill is not a solution. Patients starting pre-exposure prophylaxis may have a slight increase in the risk of getting other STDs, probably because some people feel protected from HIV, so condom usage is slightly lower. In some studies, there was no effect, in some others a slight reduction in the use of condoms has been observed, so there was a higher incidence of other STDs. HIV prevention is a combination of different things: subject that receives PrEP should also do counseling, scheduled visits for follow up, prevent other STDs etc.    Globally, taken outside the STD clinic, PrEP is a combination of: - Risk reduction: condoms, syringe, methadone injection programs; - Early diagnosis: in certain countries we have self-tests, oral tests for HIV that people can take and, if it’s positive, there’s a number to call to book an appointment and be followed by an HIV clinic; - Test and treat: means that if I discover that someone has HIV I try to treat him as soon as possible, in order to reduce ongoing transmission; - Unfortunately, the vaccine is still on its way; - PMTCT: means prevention of mother to child transmission, because it’s a very effective way to reduce numbers of new HIV positive patients; - PEP: if there’s a risk, post-exposure prophylaxis might work; - PREP: it’s just one piece of the puzzle; - Male circumcision: it has been used in several low-resources countries in the last 20 years, with a reduction in the risk of getting HIV of 50-60%. Again, combining all these interventions, we can reduce the incidence of HIV and probably get rid of it in a few years. There are several approaches to pre-exposure prophylaxis, some are topical, which is very important because in certain settings women may not be able to discuss about safe sex, so it’s something they can just provide for themselves without having to discuss it with partners. An example is Tenofovir gel that has been associated with reduction of HIV contraction. There’s a vaginal ring dapivirine that has not been developed for treatment but only for prevention.  Most of the treatments are oral combinations of drugs: Tenofovir and Emtricitabine are two nucleoside analogues inhibitors of reverse transcriptase used for therapy. Some people were already taking them as prophylaxis before going to parties19, and then randomized studies followed and demonstrated a very big  19 he cites types of parties: dark room parties. I swear this guy :’)  \nFigure 21 \nFigure 22 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 13 reduction in HIV risk. There are, still in phase 3, some drugs given intramuscular or subcutaneously every 2-3 months and they persist for a long time in blood and may prevent HIV transmission by inhibiting the virus in the vaginal, anal, oral mucosa (all mucosae that might be infected by HIV).  PREP CLINICAL TRIALS These are all the clinical trials suggesting reduction in the risk of HIV in different populations.  Those in red have been discontinued because of no effect and they were mostly performed on heterosexual women. The effectiveness of this strategy on women seems to be lower. There’s probably one pharmacologically related reason: the concentrations that these drugs reach in the vagina are much lower compared to those reached in the anus, so the protection is much lower.  There’s also need for high adherence to the clinical trial. Professor: “you are not sick, it is a prevention and so adherence has been shown to be poor in certain settings”.  Possible interpretation: heterosexual women are not affected by HIV and since this is just a prevention trial (and there might be less compliance to it), the response has been shown to be poor in certain settings, probably due to the fact that less people were adhering to the clinical trial compared to MSM.  The likely explanation for the reduced effect in PrEP CT in heterosexual women might be both the reduced effect of the drug and the reduced adherence to the CT. On the other hand, in MSM the reduction in new infection was approximately 90%, hence very effective. At the moment, there are two strategies that we can prescribe to patients if they fall in a higher risk profile (according to scores): 1. Patients take one pill once a day of tenofovir and emtricitabine called Truvada; 2. The second is an “on demand” or event-driven pre-exposure prophylaxis for patients that concentrate the number of partners in the weekends. Two pills should be taken 2-24 hours before sex20, 1 pill 24 hours later and 1 pill 48 hours after first intake. Both methods seem to be equally effective.  BARRIERS TO PREP Many colleagues consider this strategy wrong in terms of ethical considerations, but the professor says he doesn’t understand because we’re talking about risk reduction, not about what is better or worse. We are trying to reduce the risk of getting a chronic disease that is potentially deadly and costly to treat - it is also pragmatic. It’s not the only intervention, it should be seen as part of a package intervention, however ethical issues here are nonsense21. If you were to ask which are the most important barriers to pre-exposure prophylaxis in Europe, these are:  20 NdR2: aridaje con ‘sto dark room party: “to a dark room thing, to an event where they know something is going to happen” 21 We love you Calcagno even if we can’t see you \nFigure 23 18.03.2024  CALCAGNO L03 \nGiulia Nigra,Nikola Pavlos 14 the cost is one of the most important, because patients must pay for drugs. Now the cost is 30-40 euros per month (drugs are generic); the feasibility; the risk of increasing other STIs; the lower condom use. Most important ones: cost and potential compensation risk for other STIs.    PREP AT DEAN STREET, LONDON Dean Street is an STD clinic in London in which patients can present at every hour, they have counseling, psychological services, they can do swabs for diagnosis and also deal with cum sex problems. Cum sex is something growing in several cities in Europe and in the US and it increases the risk of contracting HIV at a very high level but also causes psychological problems, it’s something that should be taken care of because of sexual health but also psychological health consequences.  In Dean Street PrEP has been used for a long time, the black line in this graph (fig.13) is the number of tests per month: they test almost 6000 subjects per month, and the dotted line is the number of positive tests; there’s no reduction in the number of HIV testing but there’s a steep reduction in the number of HIV diagnosis. This is because PrEP and preventive counseling are used.    In fig.25 there is a comparison between three different clinics in the UK, where only one uses PrEP, while the other two don’t. HIV incidence is going down only in the clinic that uses PrEP. To conclude, it’s part of the task of STD clinics to counsel and prevent STIs but also HIV, and PrEP is one small piece of this puzzle.    \nFigure 24 \nFigure 25", "input": "", "output": "- epidemiology >>>\n    -

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTIONS  PROGRAM 1. Introduction and meningitis 2. Encephalitis and myelitis 3. Brain masses and septic complications of the CNS  SOURCES ● Mandell (8th edition) ● BIA guidelines   INTRODUCTION TO CNS INFECTIONS The CNS itself can be infected by several agents, including infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and helminths), but there are also a lot of conditions that can mimic CNS infections.1 An example is cancer, lymphoma can mimic a CNS infection, but also medications. Therefore, differential diagnosis is very important because timely treatment, in both scenarios, is crucial in order to avoid or at least reduce the number of long-term sequelae that these infections may have on the CNS.  The clinical presentation is often very acute and sudden. For example, in acute meningitis, a patient may develop fever, severe headaches and complications in a matter of hours or even minutes. There are also other scenarios which are sub-acute or chronic in which all the symptoms develop or worsen over weeks, and this may be a little more difficult to diagnose.  In fact, one of the key features of the CNS is that around the brain there is only a small amount of space and so any mass or any process that increases the amount of water in the cells, may compress several CNS structures that are very fragile. Therefore, complications may be very relevant and the urgency of dealing with them is of utmost importance.    THE DANISH STUDY GROUP OF INFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN DATABASE (DASGIB) In terms of data, Denmark is the best country for these studies, as they have all these centers in which they report all the clinical presentations and diagnosis of CNS infections. This (fig.1) is just to give you an idea of which are the most common conditions you might see. In this case viral meningitis is the most common, bacterial meningitis a bit less, while the third one is Lyme disease, but that is because it is Denmark and in all the Northern countries Lyme disease is a lot more frequent. After you see encephalitis, brain abscess and neurosyphilis.    CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF CNS INFECTIONS  1 From the slides: Non-infectious agents can mimic CNS infections (neoplastic, autoimmune, medications, systemic illnesses, etc.)  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   2 There are some general clinical manifestations of CNS infections, the most common being the triad of fever, headache and altered mental status.  There may also be meningism, which is related to the inflammation of the meninge although it may also be absent in several scenarios. The triad does not necessarily present together nor simultaneously; a patient may develop fever and then after a few days a headache and later on an altered mental status; or it can also be very sudden, with the patient presenting what resembles psychotic disorder or coma, i.e. altered mental status (either positive or negative, “up or down”). They may present seizures, which are a sign of CNS infection.  Clinical manifestations depend on: - The subject:  ● Age: if the patient is young (e.g. newborns) the signs and clinical presentation may be different and not the same as in adults. For instance, newborns do not lactate usually. Sometimes they present with what is called “encephalitis crying”, a high pitch, continuous cry.  ● Underlying conditions: patients with underlying conditions like dementia may be hard to diagnose as it is hard to capture changes in their mental status.  ● Surgery and trauma: neurosurgery can actually be a risk factor for some infections which are likely after these procedures. Trauma (e.g. at the base of the skull), can be a risk factor as well even after several years have passed, because the skull can be an entry point for pathogens into the CNS.  ● Immune system: immune depression is a risk factor for uncommon pathogens and presentations. For example, TB2 meningitis is uncommon in low prevalence countries (e.g. Italy), but it can be much more common in newborns and immunocompromised adults. - The microorganism (bacteria vs. viruses vs. mycobacteria...): bacteria usually cause a very acute presentation characterized by meningitis, whereas intracellular bacteria, like Borrelia (Lyme disease) may cause neuroborreliosis that is not that sudden in its presentation. TB meningitis for instance develops over weeks instead of hours. Viruses, such West Nile and Herpes Encephalitis3, have a much different onset.  - The focal involvement: involvement of certain brain areas leads to the development of specific symptoms, e.g. seizure, hemiplegia… Symptoms depend on the mass, how large it is, where it is and how large the edema around the brain mass is.   PECULIARITIES OF THE CNS \n 2 TB: Tuberculosis 3 These viruses will be mentioned further on during the course. 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   3   Fig. 2 1. Structure ● Specialized areas: every area of the brain specializes in specific activities4, thus the effect of infections in different areas varies greatly. ● Neuronal regeneration has been observed in very specific areas (hippocampus and neuro-olfactory mucosa)5, but as a general rule when neurons die they are not regenerated. ● Gray matter vs. white matter: it’s important to differentiate pathologies that affect the gray matter (i.e. the cortex), causing commonly seizures, from those affecting the white matter, which may present with neurological involvement and often seizures. For instance, Progressive Multiple Leukoencephalopathy (a white matter infection caused by JC virus6) has a different clinical outcome compared to infections related to one of the lobes.  ● No anatomical barriers: there is no defined anatomical barrier between the brain, the meninges and the spinal cord, and therefore an infection may disseminate to all of these parts of the CNS.    2. Barriers  The most known barrier to the CNS is the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) (Fig.3a), now known as the neurovascular unit. It’s composed mostly of astrocytes end-feet, pericytes, and endothelial cells linked by tight junctions. It \n 4 From the slides: Very specialized areas -> Partial ability to compensate for non-working networks 5 From the slides 6 Human polyomavirus 2, commonly referred to as the JC virus or John Cunningham virus. It will be discussed further on in the lesson about HIV AIDS infection. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   4 separates the vascular system from the brain parenchyma.  There is also a blood-CSF barrier - the choroid plexus (Fig.3b). It’s located next to the ventriculi, and it actually represents a much easier way to cross the vascular vessels into the CSF, as it only consists of one or two layers of ependymal cells. This barrier is much easier to cross by viruses, drugs and toxins. These two barriers are different compartments, also in terms of permeability.  There are also some areas in the brain that are not covered by tight junctions, resulting in enhanced sensitivity towards drugs.7 An example is the area postrema8 in the 4th ventricle, which is one of the centers involved in vomiting. It is one of the most sensitive areas to drugs, as they can easily cross into the CNS.  3. Meninges  The meninges are located below the skull and are divided into 3 layers: the dura mater, arachnoid and pia mater. The dura mater is actually in contact with the bone and is the most bone-like structure. The pia mater is in direct contact with the cortex. If there is inflammation at the level of the pia mater, a lot of WBCs and chemokines are close to the cortex and inflammation affects the neurotransmission. The arachnoid contains villi responsible for reabsorbing CSF and it is the area most commonly involved in meningeal infection. Any alteration in the dimension of the meninges, even if very small, might affect the cortex, as they are very close. For this reason, in meningitis brain parenchyma involvement and seizure are common side  7 From the slides: Areas of no tight junctions (approx. 1/5000 of the surface): ● Hypothalamus (median eminence) ● Fourth ventricle (area postrema) ● Third ventricle (subfornical organ) 8 From Wikipedia: The area postrema, a paired structure in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem, is a circumventricular organ having permeable capillaries and sensory neurons that enable its dual role to detect circulating chemical messengers in the blood and transduce them into neural signals and networks. Such roles of the area postrema include its detection of circulating hormones involved in vomiting, thirst, hunger, and blood pressure control. \nFig.  SEQ Fig. \\* \nARABIC 3  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   5 effects.  4. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) The average amount of cerebrospinal fluid is 150mL. There have been studies that say that if you collect CSF slowly in a lumbar puncture, you can take up to 45 mL. Usually, we take only 10mL in a lumbar puncture.  It is produced by the choroid plexus of each ventricle and then flows freely into the subarachnoid space and into the spinal cord and rest of the brain. From the subarachnoid space, it is absorbed into dural venous sinuses via the arachnoid villi. Any problem in this circulation is dangerous. For example, some cases of meningitis may affect the amount of proteins in the CSF and cause arachnoiditis (inflammation of arachnoid space) which may lead to an increased CSF pressure and hindrance of the circulation. This leads to an enlargement of ventriculi and symptoms due to compression of several structures.    The CSF is not static. 2/3 of CSF is obtained through ultrafiltration of plasma, while the remaining 1/3 comes from the brain extracellular fluid. It is therefore a mix of plasma and brain interstitial fluid. It does not derive only from the brain. The CSF is produced and reabsorbed completely around 3-4 times per day, but its production rate is affected by age (lower in extreme ages), cerebral perfusion pressure, drugs (e.g. diuretics), and circadian variations (e.g. the rate in the morning may differ from the one in the afternoon). 5. Lymphatics In the past, it was actually believed that there were no lymphatic vessels in the CNS. However, in 2015 the presence of some lymphatic vessels next to the meningeal spaces was demonstrated. They are not fully developed vessels, but anatomically delimited spaces in which the lymph may flow. It is then drained, usually into the nasal associated lymphatic tissue next to the olfactory nerve and then to the deep neck cervical lymph nodes.  Before, it was thought that the immune tolerance in the brain was almost total, while in recent years it has been understood that there is actually some immune control in the brain, and some T and few B lymphocytes Fig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n4 \nFig.  SEQ Fig. \\* \nARABIC 5  \nFig.  SEQ Fig. \\* ARABIC 6  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   6 may be resident in the lymphatic vessels next to the meningeal spaces.   LUMBAR PUNCTURE \nLumbar puncture is a maneuver performed in order to withdraw CSF. It is usually performed with the patient in a lateral recumbent position on a firm surface with the back at the edge of the table/bed, or sitting with their back curved.  The patient has to be reassured with the help of a nurse by explaining what they will experience in terms of pain, when they will feel the needle, and by telling them that they might feel some kind of electrical shock in the legs. It’s a sterile maneuver, and some time should be taken to prepare for it. It’s usually performed between L3 and L4, but can also be done between L2 and L3 because usually the spinal cord ends between T12 and L1 (so there is no risk of harming it).  The reference point is the iliac crest. Touching it with the second finger and putting the first finger in the middle of the back usually gives the location of L3 and L4. After a lumbar puncture, patients should lie in bed with a pillow for at least 2 hours. Some people suggest remaining in a prone position, but there is no evidence-based information on this.  The patient should be told about the complications of lumbar puncture. They are listed below: 1. Headache (10-25%): in 1-3% is orthostatic (worsens when standing up, leading to a severe headache, so the patient usually goes back to bed and it may last weeks). It’s not common, but in some cases the headache may last several days, making patients unwilling to repeat the puncture in the future. The headaches are believed to be associated with CSF leakage at the site of puncture and not with the amount removed. Therefore, 10-15 and even up to 25-30mL of CSF can be safely withdrawn. In research setting, U.S. physicians withdraw very slowly 50 mL of CSF, but usually 7-15 mL is pretty safe in normal conditions.  Automatic needles9 may be associated with a steep reduction in headaches.   In cases of very severe persistent (days) headache after a lumbar puncture, “blood patches” may be used by neurosurgeons in order to close the small hole in the dura mater made during the puncture.  2. Infections: very uncommon if the procedure is performed in a sterile manner. Even if the puncture is performed in a patient with bacteremia (in order to understand whether it’s just sepsis or if it’s a CNS infection), the risk of CSF infection caused by the maneuver itself is very low. Instead, lumbar puncture  9 They will be discussed later. \n \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   7 should be avoided in case of an established infection in the lumbar space (such as spinal epidural abscess, spinal subdural empyema, or some superficial or deep paraspinal infection than can be clearly seen on the skin).  3. Local bleeding: usually mild unless coagulation disorders are present. Coagulation parameters (platelet count, PT and PTT) should be checked before performing a lumbar puncture.  4. Brain herniation: the most relevant complication in terms of consequences. It’s usually the cerebellar tonsils that may be herniated and compress the brainstem, causing death during LP. The compression of the brainstem may lead to severe cardiovascular complication such as inhibition of respiration/breathing, extreme tachypnea, severe tachycardia and cardiac death. It is very uncommon. It has been observed in patients with severe intracranial pressure. The highest risk is represented by masses in the posterior fossa, so mostly in the cerebellum (dislocation of brainstem and cerebrum). In high-resource countries, before doing LP, it is important to ask for a brain image and perform a CT scan in ALL patient before undergoing the lumbar puncture, since it’s fast, does not have severe contraindications and provides information about brain masses. A neurosurgeon should also be asked to assess the risk of brain herniation. The problem is that in the poor countries of the world with limited resources, we do not have a CT scan. There a certain signs that suggest to defer LP. LP should be deferred in case of clinical signs of impending herniation: - Deteriorating level of consciousness: if the GCS10 is below 11 and if the deterioration was fast, lumbar puncture must not be done. The patient should be treated as if he had bacterial meningitis or encephalitis, and the doctor should try to understand what is going on. - Brainstem signs, including pupillary changes, posturing and/or irregular respiration. These are signs of potential damages to the brainstem, so LP should never be performed without a previous brain imaging since it may be harmful. - Very recent seizures: they may be a sign of the presence of brain masses.  HOW TO MEASURE INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE (IPC)11 There are several research tools for the evaluation of ICP, but the most important ones in clinical practice are:  1. Brain imaging (CT/MRI): indirect way of measuring ICP which provides information about brain masses.  2. Fundus oculi exam: upon checking the fundus oculi (the inner posterior portion of the eye), papilledema, a sign of increased CSF pressure, may be visible.  However, the sign shows up with a delay, so an acute rise in ICP may be missed with this method.  3. Ocular nerve ultrasound: in resource-limited settings where ultrasound is available, several studies suggest the observation of the ocular nerve thickness, which is said to be directly proportional to the ICP.  A very recent study (Fig.10) was carried out last year to evaluate if performing a brain imaging before a lumbar puncture would actually delay the initiation of treatment. The times between emergency department  10 Glasgow Coma Scale 11 The professor suggests the article “Invasive and noninvasive means of measuring intracranial pressure: a review” published by Xuan Zhang et al. in 2017 \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   8 arrivals and the start of antibiotic therapy between patients with and without CT before LP were similar (134 vs 141 minutes respectively, so just a matter of a couple of hours), therefore actually there is nearly no delay caused by performing imaging. \n  Fig. 10  LUMBAR PUNCTURE – THE NEEDLE In the bottom of Fig.11 there is a traumatic needle. This type of needle may damage the dura mater by cutting it and leaving a hole. In the top, instead, an atraumatic needle (Sprotte or Panjunk) in pictured. The tip is more similar to that of a pencil, so this needle doesn’t cause much damage to the dura mater. The dura mater contains nervous fibers that might be damaged directly by the maneuver, and the CSF might leak out from the hole induced by a traumatic needle. For this reason, atraumatic needles are now considered the best way to perform LP. Using them, complications such as headaches, are reduced to less than 3%. They have now been used for the last 5-6 years and post-LP headaches have become really uncommon.

Then, according to clinical suspicions: - Viral culture/PCR - Smear, PCR and culture for acid-fast bacilli (e.g. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis) - VDRL:12 a Treponema test carried out mainly in case of suspicion of neurosyphilis - India Ink staining and CrAg (Cryptococcus Neoformans Antigen test) to look for cryptococcal infection; the CrAg is more sensitive. - Giemsa stain13: may be used in case of suspicion of parasites, protozoa and helminths infection. - Fungal culture in case fungal infection is suspected. - IgM (+/- IgG): used for some infections, mainly viral, such as West Nile and Borrelia - Cytology and flow cytometry: can be used to rule out lymphoma or metastasis and defines the cells found in CSF.  Normal values of CSF:  ● Opening pressure: not really a routine measure but it can be done easily; it should be around 50-195 mm H2O. ● Appearance: should be clear and colorless ● Cell count: the CSF contains some cells, mostly lymphomonocytes, but usually less than 5 cells/mm3 ● Glucose: should be measured at the same time as a contemporary glycemia test. Usually, a finger test for glycemia is carried out right at the end of the lumbar puncture procedure in order to have two comparable values. However, in some settings, like in the emergency room, the blood test may be done in the morning and the LP in the afternoon, so glycemia is not contemporary. Value should be >50% of contemporary glycemia. ● Proteins: <45-55 mg/dL ● (Chloride): Some laboratories also test chloride levels, which provide information about inflammation and risk of bacterial infection.

Traumatic lumbar puncture is a common consequence whereby peripheral blood is introduced into the CSF distorting the true cell counts. The CSF correction of white blood cell count (WBC) equation (reported above) was derived to reflect the true CSF WBC count through accounting for and excluding contributions from the peripheral blood.14  The absence of CSF WBCs does not rule out encephalitis. Actually, in 5% of cases of Herpes Encephalitis the cell count is normal during first lumbar puncture, while a second LP performed 48-72 hours later presents leukocytosis (increased number of WBCs in the CSF).  Xanthochromia Xanthochromia15 is the yellow or yellow-orange supernatant of centrifuged CSF. It is reported by the lab together with the results of the CSF tests. It is usually due to lysis of RBC16 and it is usually more common in early stages17. It is observed in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage, while traumatic LPs have clear supernatants because the RBC are usually intact since there is not enough time for RBC hemolysis to occur. It might also be observed when there is a very high level of proteins in the CSF (>150 mg/dL) or in case of jaundice.

In Fig.13 there is a depiction of what might be seen. According to the position of the dots, different scenarios might be recognised. The orange line provides an index of BBB impairment. A high albumin ratio (seen by moving along the orange arrow towards the top-right portion of the graph, ed.) reflects an increased concentration of albumin, which is a big molecule, in the CSF, indicating a leakage through the BBB and therefore an impairment of the barrier. On top of the orange arrow, the purple line represents the production of IgG in the CNS. So, after correcting this value for albumin concentration, the amount of IgGs produced in the CNS - related to those in the periphery - can be checked. It is a measure of intrathecal inflammation, hence it indicates whether there is an ongoing inflammatory process and how many of these immunoglobulins are being produced locally. Overall, it’s very cheap and can help to get an idea of the situation. Subsequent tests define if the IgGs are monoclonal, polyclonal or oligoclonal. Oligoclonal IgGs in the CSF is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a disease characterized by an autoimmune process in the brain.  MENINGITIS Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges and/or of the CSF, i.e. the liquid within the meninges. The onset of meningeal symptoms is usually acute, over a matter of hours or at most a few days. There are also some forms of chronic meningitis in which symptoms appear over a time span of a few weeks or months (usually > 4 weeks), but they are very uncommon.  PRIMARY CLASSIFICATION Meningitis can be divided into bacterial and aseptic.  ● Bacterial meningitis usually presents an unclear purulent CSF, which might appear yellowish or whitish. The CSF contains an elevated number of cells, up to thousands, mostly granulocytes and neutrophils. At the beginning of this process there might be a predominant increase of lymphocytes. Other findings in the CSF include elevated levels of proteins and low glucose concentration18. It’s mainly due to bacteria, whereas other causes (such as Amoeba or Cerebral abscesses) are less common. It is important to remember that since some of these bacteria are transmittable person-to-person, the patient should be isolated.   ● Aseptic meningitis: CSF is clear and colorless, with sometimes “dust-like” particles. The number of cells, usually lympho-monocytes, is elevated but usually to a lower extent compared to bacterial meningitis. Protein concentration is also elevated but again, not as much as for BM. Glucose concentration is normal, because viruses do not use glucose (the same is true for intracellular bacteria). Etiological agents may be viruses, intracellular bacteria (Leptospira, Brucella, Borrelia...), or partially treated bacterial meningitis. In fact, a patient at home with bacterial meningitis who has  18 Glucose concentration is low because it is consumed by the bacteria. \nFig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC 13  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   12 been treated with antibiotics, might present with difficult-to-recognize symptoms and a CSF resembling aseptic meningitis. Always ask patients if they have been taking antibiotics.  The orange line (last row) in Fig.14 represents an exception of aseptic meningitis in which the CSF appears clear, the cell count remains in the same range as before, maybe consisting of lymphomonocytes and neutrophils at the beginning, but there is very high level of proteins and low glucose levels. In this case, the main suspicion is Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; to sum up, TB meningitis has very clear CSF presentation, resembling aseptic meningitis, but glucose is heavily consumed. Fungi could also be a possible cause but a \npretty rare one.   EPIDEMIOLOGY ● Bacterial Meningitis The two most common causes are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis, but it may also be due to Haemophilus influenzae. In general, Bacterial Meningitis is not common, but the situation changes from country to country. In western countries (Finland, Netherlands, and the United States) the incidence is 0.7-0.9 per 100,000 people/year, and over time in the last 30 years the prevalence has reduced thanks to vaccination. In some African countries like Burkina Faso and Malawi the incidence is still very high, 10-40 per 100,000 people/year.   ● Aseptic meningitis: - Predominantly caused by Enteroviruses - In the US 30-75,000 cases/year - Predominance of infection during summer and fall in areas with a temperate climate because people spend more time outdoor, while in areas with tropical climates the infection is present all year round - It’s spread from person-to-person mainly through fecal-oral transmission, although houseflies, wastewater and sewage may contribute to the spread  - It may affect both children and adults  - Risk factors such as rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, have been associated with a higher chance of presenting aseptic meningitis    \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   13 THE “MENINGITIS BELT”   The area in Sub-Saharan Africa was named this way due to the recurrent epidemics that occur every year due to Neisseria meningitidis. They are usually due to non-B serotypes, mostly serogroup A, although after the MenA19 vaccination (2010) C, Y, W135 and X have also been more common20.   There is a higher risk during dry season (December-June); the suspicion is that the dust particles may carry the meningococci leading to a larger spread which may cause several epidemics. Every 5-10 years21 there is a large-scale epidemic in the area. Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia are requested a certification of vaccination in order to the avoid spread.   MENINGITIS VALUES IN ITALY  In 2015 and 2016 there has been a rise in meningitis C cases in Italy, for which Tuscany was the epicenter and actually the only region involved. In Piedmont there were around 10-15 cases every year, but in Tuscany the number of cases was its double in 2015 and triple in 2016. It was mostly due to meningococci C, even in vaccinated patients. It therefore raised questions about its virulence and about the effectiveness of the vaccination.  \n 19 Meningococcal A vaccine  20 From the slides: 1000 per 100k pop 21 In the slides it’s 5-12 years \nFig.  SEQ Fig. \n\\* ARABIC 16  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   14   Fig.17 shows the most recent data from Piedmont. Aseptic meningitis is the most common form, with an incidence of 50-100 cases every year, while the incidence of bacterial meningitis (mostly meningococcal meningitis) is around 10-15 cases every year. In both cases the trend has remained quite stable over the last 7 years. However, in the last years, the incidence has reduced to almost zero, because of mask usage but also because Piedmont started to have vaccination for the Meningococcus B strand.   This (fig.18) is a graph showing the effect of vaccination on the etiology. You can see that overtime, when the \nvaccine was introduced, for example H. influenzae vaccine, N. meningitis vaccine, there has been a steep reduction of the strains. The one that is still present is S. pneumoniae, because the vaccination is reserved for people over 65 and those with chronic lungs problems, and is not that effective. The primary cycle of the vaccine is administered very young, and it protects from pneumonia below the age of five. When people are older they get revaccinated.  From fig. 19, it is possible to see that there is a very strong age determinant. For example, some of these affects only newborns, like S. agalactiae. N. menigitis as well is mostly see in the young ones, below the age of 20. S. pneumoniae is more common below the age of 5 (that’s why we vaccinate children) but then is again present below the age of 65.  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   15  Fig. 19    CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF MENINGITIS  As anticipated, the most common causative agents of meningitis nowadays is Streptococcus pneumoniae22 (45%), followed by Neisseria meningitidis (25%), then by group B Streptococcus23 (15%), Listeria monocytogenes (10%), and a very small number due to Haemophilus influenzae (5%).  Over time, there has been a steep decrease of Neisseria and Haemophilus infections due to the widespread vaccination, and therefore the incidence is actually lower than the values previously mentioned, so although it varies depending on the country, it may even be as low as 0.1cases/100K people/year24. There is a lot of risk factors for the development of meningitis, for example immunodepression and splenectomy, because people without  22 a.k.a. Pneumococcus 23 Recall that the only member of GBS (Group B Streptococci) is Streptococcus agalactiae, as explained by prof. Lembo, ed. 24 From the slides: 0.12-3 cases/100k persons/year \nFig.17  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   16 spleen have a higher risk of capsulated bacterial infection.   ● Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus Pneumoniae is the main cause of meningitis in patients above the age of 20, so it has to be suspected in adults. The most important risk factors are sinusitis and otitis media. Most of the patients have a history of sinusitis or ear pain that has not been treated. This is because the bacteria colonize the sinuses or the ear and after that they can create a contact and get directly into the meninges. Performing a CT scan, it is possible to notice bone involvement and perforation, which allows bacteria to cross and enter into the CNS.   CT scans are essential: first, because they detect the presence of masses. Among the numerous bacteria, there is one able to relocate from the throat to the circulation and then to reach the brain, where it replicates leading to a very high bacterial load, which results in severe clinical manifestations.25 The second reason is that entry points to the brain should be repaired. If a patient has a damaged bone wall, this must be repaired immediately to prevent recurrent meningitis by pneumococci. The professor had a patient who had meningitis from streptococcus seven times, because he had rhino-liquorrhea due to a small damage in the skull bone. They saw the damage with a CT scan and repaired it. Moreover, people who had traumatic damages to their skull, for example after a motorcycle accident, have a higher risk of developing meningitis in their life.  There are other less common risk factors such as pneumonia, alcohol abuse, diabetes, splenectomy, hypogammaglobulinemia, complement deficiency, fracture of the skull base, and rhino-liquorrhea (more due to damage in the bone structure).  Mortality is still quite high, around 18-26%, and in older adults it rises to 30-35%.  ● Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria meningitis is most common in children and young adults (2-20 years of age).  Epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis occur only in 2% of cases, while the remaining 98% of cases are sporadic. There are differences in different strains in terms of virulence. Some deficiencies in humoral immunity or complement (C6 to C9) might explain the difference in vulnerability in different individuals. However, usually the first step consists of a transient nasopharyngeal colonization, which can be observed in 5-10% of the normal population. Then the bacteria might outgrow and give rise to an invasive disease with a mortality of around 10%26 (much lower than Pneumococcus but still quite relevant).  One of the warning/alert signs that should be explained to the children’s mothers is the presence of petechiae, which are usually very relevant in the course of the infection and can be the first step of a fulminant disease, leading to death within few hours after the onset of the petechiae. So, a child with very \n 25 This is my best interpretation of what the professor says in slide 36 (00:47): “First, because it tells you something about (body/bony?) mass. There is a lot of bacteria; there is just one bacterium that was in the throat, gets in the circulation and went to the brain. Here there is a very high bacterial load and for this reason the severity of the disease is very high.”  A better explanation may be found from the article “Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Pneumococcal Meningitis”: The most common route of infection starts by nasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which must avoid mucosal entrapment and evade the host immune system after local activation. During invasive disease, pneumococcal epithelial adhesion is followed by bloodstream invasion and activation of the complement and coagulation systems. The release of inflammatory mediators facilitates pneumococcal crossing of the blood-brain barrier into the brain, where the bacteria multiply freely and trigger activation of circulating antigen-presenting cells and resident microglial cells. The resulting massive inflammation leads to further neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, resulting in the well-known features of bacterial meningitis 26 From the slides: Mortality 3-13% 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   17 high fever, uncommon behavior and petechiae should be taken to the emergency room as soon as possible.   Fig.21 reports a list of all the major infectious (viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, spirochetes, protozoa and helminths, and other infectious syndromes) and non-infectious causes (intracranial tumors and cysts, drugs, \nsystemic illnesses, procedure-related and some miscellaneous causes) of symptoms that are similar to acute meningitis. This gives an idea of the complexity of the differential diagnosis of meningitis.   ASEPTIC MENINGITIS – ETIOLOGY Enteroviruses are a large group of viruses, there is cocksackievirus, echovirus, poliovirus. They are neurotrophic, that is why they can infect the brain. Another important group is the arboviruses. A common question the professor asks to students at the exam is: “when you think about meningitis, when you perform a lumbar puncture and you can see a clear CSF, so an aseptic meningitis, which are the viruses you think first?” and the answer is enteroviruses and arboviruses.   \nFig.  \nSEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n21 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   18 OTHER CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF MENINGITIS Some risk factors of the other causative agents of meningitis are listed in fig.22.  \nFor example, Staphylococcus aureus infection is sometimes observed in hospitalized patients and after neurosurgery. Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae may also be present in patients that have been hospitalized with severe co-morbidities and after neurosurgery. Haemophilus Influenzae Type B is sometimes observed in children, more commonly in the USA than in Europe, but unvaccinated children are more prone to this infection.  Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) is usually observed in elderly but also in newborns, so mothers are screened for the presence of GBS in the vagina.   ● Listeria monocytogenes One important causative agent of meningitis is Listeria monocytogenes, which usually causes an aseptic meningitis27, but sometimes the CSF is not clear. It might be observed in newborns, pregnant women, elderly and immune deficient patients including homeless people, cirrhotic patients, end-stage kidney-diseased patients and alcohol abusers.28 The epidemics in the last years have involved foie gras, watermelons from Australia, and carne mechada from Spain. So, there are different foods that can carry Listeria bacterium, although in the beginning only cheese was thought to be involved, mostly soft cheeses. That is why pregnant women are suggested to not eat them, because listeria infection in pregnancy can be dangerous both for the mother and the fetus.  Listeria infection is therefore a foodborne disease and quite uncommon, affecting 3-6 people/1 million/year in Italy.  A French study conducted by MONALISA29 collected all the cases with a 2 year follow up and reported the different presentations associated with Listeria infection.  27 This is what the professor says. However, several sources on the Internet claim that it’s a bacterial meningitis, not aseptic (e.g. the article “Aseptic and Bacterial Meningitis: Evaluation, Treatment, and Prevention” by H. R. Mount et al.). 28 From the slides: Older age, innate and cellular immune defects, malignances, HIV infection, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and immunosuppressive therapies. 29 “Clinical features and prognostic factors of listeriosis: the MONALISA national prospective cohort study” by Chralier C. et al.

The cases were divided into maternal cases (i.e. during pregnancy), bacteremia (i.e. patients in which Listeria was isolated in blood cultures) and neurolisteriosis (in which there was CNS involvement). As shown, patients with neurolisteriosis were older, with an average age of 67, and they had some comorbidities (around 3 per patient). 97% of patients presented fever, whereas diarrhea and septic shock were not so common. The Glasgow Coma Scale was 12, which is a relevant value. 2/3 of the patients had positive blood cultures for Listeria once the CNS was involved.  In fig.24, the mortality rates recorded by the study are shown. In the graph on the left (A), the red line (lower) indicates bacteremia cases (46%), whereas the green (middle) represents neurological cases (30%). It is possible to see that the mortality in bacterial cases (blue line) is very low, 0%. Mortality was “intermediate” in patients with neurological symptoms. This may be due to the fact that neurological cases allowed a rapid recognition of the problem, while bacteremia was more difficult to recognize because the symptoms were pretty a-specific.

It is a prognostic factor in viral pneumonia, such as Covid-19 disease, which will be dealt with later during the course. \n \nFig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n24 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   21 ● Bacterial meningitis    Nasopharyngeal colonization is usually the first step. It is then followed by local invasion, often bacteremia, invasion of the meninges, then a process of microvascular invasion starts, with macrophages, neutrophils and other CNS cells releasing cytokines, leading to subarachnoid space inflammation and possibly cerebral vasculitis and cerebral infarction. Remember that most of these infections are associated with secondary vasculitis and vascular problems in the CNS.  In Fig.26, some of the bacterial and host features that might favor each of these steps are depicted. Some of these may favors mucosal colonization, intravascular survival, meningeal invasion or survival in the subarachnoid space – all of these may increase persistence, invasiveness and pathogenicity of this bacteria.                     ● Aseptic meningitis There are different ways for viruses to reach the CNS32.  1. Mucosal colonization involving either the peri-tonsillar lymphatics or Peyer’s patches in the gut, leading then to viremia and finally to the crossing of the BBB by the viral particles 2. Some viruses are carried by leukocytes (e.g. Measles, Mumps, Herpes) 3. Directly enter the CNS by crossing the choroid plexus 4. Olfactory nerves may also be a way of entry (e.g. influenza) 5. Peripheral nerves may also be a route entry into the CNS (e.g. Herpes virus).      CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS   32 This topic will be discussed in more detail when dealing with the pathogenesis of encephalitis. \nFig. 25  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   22 ● Bacterial meningitis  Headache, fever and meningismus33 are the most common symptoms of bacterial meningitis, followed by altered sensorium34. Others signs and symptoms like vomiting, seizures, focal neurological findings and papilledema may vary. ● In neonates, however, the clinical manifestations are different. Meningismus is usually absent, and newborns may present instead temperature instability (hypo- or hyperthermia), listlessness35, high-pitched crying, fretfulness, lethargy, refusal to feed, weak suction, irritability, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, or respiratory distress.  ● In very young children, bulging fontanelle36 may be observed. Neck stiffness, seizures (outside the febrile-convulsion age range), and reduced food intake37 are also typically found in children. ● In adults, fever, nuchal rigidity and altered mental status are seen only in 2/3 of the patients. The classical case is very easy to recognize, but in 1/3 of cases there are uncommon symptoms that might render the diagnosis more difficult. Also, depending on whether patients took antibiotics, there could be the presentation of different or less common signs.   Fig.28 depicts a patient intubated because of a pneumococcal meningitis. Notice how his body is covered by numerous petechiae. The intubation is required in order to protect the airways since the value of the Glasgow Coma Scale is so low that the patient is unable to breathe autonomously.    \n In order to provide clear advice to families, the meningitis glass test may be employed (fig.29). The presence  33 Meningismus = A state of meningeal irritation with symptoms suggesting meningitis.  34 From Wikipedia: A clouded sensorium, also known as an altered sensorium, is a medical condition characterized by the inability to think clearly or concentrate. 35 From Dictionary.com: Listlessness = having or showing little or no interest in anything; languid; spiritless; indifferent: a listless mood. 36 The presence of bulging fontanelle usually worries the mothers. Once, the professor has seen such a big bulging fontanelle that it has very hard and impossible to be pressed back into the skull. The following information was provided by the sbobinatore: A fontanel, also called fontanelle, is more commonly known as a soft spot. When a baby’s born, they typically have several fontanels where bones of their skull haven’t fused yet. A newborn has fontanels on the top, back, and sides of their head. Changes in texture or appearance can be a sign of serious health issues. Parents should watch for soft spots that are curved outward on their baby’s head and feel very firm. This is known as a bulging fontanel and may be a sign of brain swelling or fluid buildup in the brain. A bulging fontanel is an emergency. It can be a sign of pressure rising inside the skull which may result in damage to the baby’s developing brain. 37 From the slides. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   23 of fever with spots/rash/petechiae that do not fade after pressing the side of a clear glass firmly against the skin, indicates a medical emergency.  ● Aseptic Meningitis  ● Neonates usually present fever and gastrointestinal discomfort such as vomiting and anorexia. They may also present a rash and upper respiratory tract symptoms such as cough. Sometimes also nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelle are present. In newborns, outcomes may be very severe when infection occurs early on, i.e. through transplacental transmission, which may lead to Multiple Organ Failure.  ● In children and adults, fever is usually present and it may be biphasic – an acute early fever followed by a later second rise in temperature. 50% of the patients present nuchal rigidity, usually with headache and photophobia38, often accompanied by non-specific symptoms including: ■ pleurodynia39, herpangina40, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease41 caused by Coxsackievirus, which are a subfamily of Enteroviruses ■ scattered maculopapular rash caused by Echovirus 9 ■ pleural and pericardial effusion caused by Coxsackievirus B42 ■ enteroviruses, typically Enterovirus 71, can lead to some severe syndromes in older children (mortality up to 14%).  Fig.30 shows a patient with herpangina, a typical symptom associated with aseptic meningitis. It is one of the oral manifestations of enterovirus infection, and it is characterized by ulcers on the back of the throat which cluster together in the same area. SIGNS OF MENINGITIS  There are several signs that a neurologist should look for in a patient with meningitis. The most important two according to the professor’s opinion are the neck rigidity (Brudzinski sign) and the Kernig sign.  In meningitis, the neck is stiff making the patient unable to bend the neck over the chest, and its passive flexion by the physician causes flexion of both legs and thighs (Brudzinski sign).  The Kernig sign is positive when a patient lying down with the hip flexed at 90° cannot fully extend the knee.  All these signs are signs of inflammation of the meninges and of the spinal nerves, and are due to the involuntary attempt of the patient to reduce the pain caused by these maneuvers. The position of meningitis patients is the lateral position, with the head extended and the eyes closed, and they do not move. This is very typical of meningitis, as every movement is painful. \n 38 Photophobia = extreme sensitivity to light 39 Pleurodynia = severe pain in the muscles between the ribs or in the diaphragm, caused typically by Coxsackie B 40 Herpangina, also called mouth blisters, is a painful mouth infection caused by coxsackieviruses, usually coxsackievirus A 41 Hand, foot, and mouth disease: A common illness of infants and children under 10 years old characterized by fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters due to infection most commonly with coxsackievirus A16 or less often enterovirus 71 or another enterovirus. 42 From the slides: Coxsackievirus A -> herpangina while B -> pleural and pericardial effusion Fig. 30  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   24  Fig. 31 Another sign of meningitis that has been recently introduced is the jolt accentuation of headache. It is performed by rotating 1-2 times the head of a patient with headache, resulting in a steep accentuation of the pain. The professor doesn’t consider this test to be very specific for meningitis, as no one would be very happy to have their head rotated if they had a headache, which would probably worsen after this maneuver.  DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis is based on the CSF analysis. In bacterial meningitis, gram staining (often positive) and culture exam (positive in 70-90% of the cases) are needed. Bacterial antigens may be obtained quickly (usually within one hour), and even though their sensitivity is not very high (70%), specificity is approximately 100%. PCR is the most sensitive and specific technique both for bacterial and aseptic meningitis.  Bear in mind that stool or throat swabs for enteroviruses have a specificity for 96%, so they might be useful.    There are also some scores that might be helpful. For example, the Bacterial Meningitis Score suggests that \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   25 there is low risk (NPV 99.7%) of bacterial meningitis when:  ● CSF gram stain is negative ● CSF absolute neutrophil count < 1,000 ● CSF protein < 80 mg/dL ● peripheral absolute neutrophil count < 10,000.  Lactate can also be used for the differential diagnosis between bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Elevated CSF lactate concentration suggests bacterial meningitis, for which it shows a sensitivity of 93-97% and a specificity of 94-96%, better than some other CSF parameters.43  FILM ARRAY It is possible to perform multiple PCRs, i.e. PCRs that are carried out at the same time for two different targets. This technique is called film array, and it covers the most important bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus B, Escherichia coli), yeasts like Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii and the most important viruses44 (Enterovirus, Herpes 1 to 6, Human parechovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Cytomegalovirus). The results can be available in 2-6 hours, which can be very helpful in targeting treatment.   COMPLICATIONS  There are many. In the case of bacterial: DIC, sepsis and shock. There are several neurological complications, including cranial nerve palsies, that can be examined by pressing the cranial nerves inducing palsies. Other complications include seizures, focal signs, hydrocephalus. The latter is caused by CSF cannot flow, so the ventricles enlarge and this can induce coma. There are also several sub-acute and chronic complication. A complication very important in children is neurodevelopmental delay.   MANAGEMENT ● Rapid initiation of antimicrobial treatment is fundamental and it’s the first thing to do. It should be initiated within hours even if the lumbar puncture is delayed.45  ● Management of elevated intracranial pressure: it includes procedures like the specific position of the head at 30°, CSF drainage (suggested in certain situations), osmotic dehydration by using 0.25-0.5 g/kg of mannitol (advised in cases of edema or brain masses). Mass removal or decompression may also be necessary, for example in case of a very big brain abscess. Also hypothermia and hyperventilation can be employed to treat ICU46 patients with elevated intracranial pressure.  43 From the slides. 44 Not all the viruses, but the majority of them. 45 Recall the study reported in Fig.9, which suggested that within 2 hours all patients were started on antibiotic treatment. 46 ICU: intensive care unit \nFig.31  \nFig. 34  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   26 ● Management of seizures: seizures should be managed with anticonvulsants, usually after consulting a neurologist. ● Fluid management: administration and replacement of fluids is necessary to maintain a normovolemic state. Fluids may be lost due to sweating in case of fever, tachypnea in case of sepsis, or simply because patients do not eat or hydrate properly. The balance of volemia is important in critical care patients with severe CNS infections.   ANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENT – BACTERIAL MENINGITIS Professor says he usually does not ask this at the exam.  ● Ceftriaxone [2g x 2/day]: The standard treatment for bacterial meningitis is Ceftriaxone at double dose because it has to cross the BBB.47 ● Vancomycin [15-20 mg/Kg x 2/day]: if in the last 6 months the patient has had a recent trip to a country or has been living in a country with penicillin-Resistant-pneumococci, vancomycin is suggested as an additional agent (so, ceftriaxone plus vancomycin).  ● Ampicillin (amoxicillin) [2g x 6/day]: in newborns, patients above the age of 60 and immunocompromised subjects (including diabetics and alcohol abusers), the addition of ampicillin or amoxicillin is suggested in case of Listeria and mostly when the CSF appears clear.  ● Chloramphenicol [25 mg/Kg x 4/day]: in case of a history of severe allergies or anaphylaxis to penicillin and cephalosporins, chloramphenicol may be used instead with or without the addition of Cotrimoxazole [2.5-5 mg/kg x 4/day].    Fig.35 shows in red the countries that are suggested to have a significant prevalence (> 5%) of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Italy48 is one of these nations49. This means that in these areas, in order to protect the patient against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, vancomycin should be administered in addition to ceftriaxone in most of the cases. Then, after the results of the culture and the antibiogram are out, ceftriaxone may be given by itself, without a second antibiotic.   The duration of the antibiotic treatment is indicated as follows: ● S. pneumoniae: treatment should last 10-14 days (14 days if there is a slow recovery or the if the culture reveals a penicillin-resistant strain) ● Neisseria meningitidis: British guidelines suggest 5 days, whereas in Italy treatment usually last 5 to 7 days ● Listeria monocytogenes: the therapy is longer, around 21 days (3 weeks) ● Other bacteria: the duration ranges from 10 days to 3 weeks according to clinical conditions.  47 From the slides: Cefotaxime (2g x 4/day) may also be used 48 “We will see in our discussion that Italy is always red on the maps, so it’s bad” cit. 49 From the slides: The other countries are Canada, China, Croatia, Greece, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Spain, Turkay, and USA. \nFig.32  Fig. 35  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   27  Other compounds can be used too. In Fig.37, the CPR (CSF to plasma ratio) of the drugs is shown, both in normal conditions (3rd column) or in case of inflamed meninges (4th column), so in the first days of treatment. Most drugs reach very low concentrations (2-5%) with just a few exceptions. Most of the medications reported can be safely used and in some cases the dose may be increased. For instance, Linezolid is one of the oxazolidinone antibiotics used for treating resistant gram-positive infections and it can also be employed effectively against various CNS infections thanks to its good pharmacokinetics in the CSF. \n Fig. 37 In some cases, an intraventricular antibiotic therapy may be employed. It is usually performed in neurosurgery wards after a neurosurgical intervention. In fact, it can be difficult to treat ventriculitis (i.e. infection of the ventriculi) with normal antibiotics, so in some cases the antibiotics are instead directly injected inside the ventricles for a few days in order to increase the amount of drugs reaching the target and to reduce the bacterial load. Afterwards, systemic therapy is continued.   Risk factors for a fatal outcome in meningococcal disease50 There are some risk factors that should be considered when dealing with a patient with meningococcal disease are:51  50 From Wikipedia: Meningococcal disease describes infections caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (also termed meningococcus). 51 In bold are the most important ones. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   28 ● Low or normal peripheral WBC count: it means no response from the immune system ● Low acute phase reactants such as PCR and ESR ● Low platelets: it implies blood vessels involvement ● Coagulopathy: it implies liver involvement ● Absence of meningitis ● Hypotension and shock: the progression of meningococcal sepsis can be very rapid, and in some cases it can progress within few hours into MOF and death ● Rapidly progressing rash ● Coma ● Lactate > 4 mmol/L52  PROPHYLAXIS -   Neisseria meningitidis: it is the only bacterium that can be spread from person-to-person.53 As transmission is mediated by droplets, anyone who has come into close contact (roughly within a 1-meter distance) with an infected patient displaying fever, without protection, is considered to be at risk of infection. This includes family members, doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc. All these people should therefore be treated prophylactically with Ciprofloxacin or Rifampicin.   -   Haemophilus influenzae: despite being uncommon, it is also easily transmissible by close contact, therefore it’s suggested to receive prophylaxis with Rifampicin because of the high degree of colonization and chance of infection.   It is very important to isolate the patient with active meningitis.  \n  CORTICOSTEROIDS A review from the Cochrane library54 reports the updated version of “Corticosteroids for acute bacterial meningitis”. The professor highlighted three sentences in purple and one in yellow (here reported), which  52 From the slides. 53 This is what the professor says, although to me it seems incorrect since many other bacteria causing meningitis have person-to-person transmission, such as S. pneumoniae (from Wikipedia: It spreads by direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by autoinoculation). Maybe he meant that Neisseria meningitidis is the only bacterium responsible for meningococcal meningitis and it is spread from person-to-person, or that the bacterium only infects humans since there is no animal reservoir. 54 “Cochrane reviews are a bit boring to read, I think everyone - well, epidemiologists - just read the main results” cit. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   29 are the main concepts that must remembered55: 1. “There was insufficient evidence that corticosteroids caused a reduction in mortality overall. However, they caused lower rates of severe hearing loss, any hearing loss, and neurological sequelae”. 2. “Corticosteroids reduced mortality in Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis” 3. “Corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss in children with H. Influenzae meningitis, but not in children with meningitis due to non-Haemophilus species” 4. “In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss, any hearing loss and short-term neurological sequelae. There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries” There is evidence suggesting that in children the use of corticosteroids was associated with lower rates of severe hearing loss and neurological sequelae, mainly in cases of Haemophilus influenzae infection. Corticosteroids also reduce mortality in Streptococcus Pneumoniae meningitis and, despite the differences between high- and low-income countries, globally the suggestion is to use short-term corticosteroids for the first days of bacterial meningitis. It is important to administer these drugs as soon as possible, therefore right before giving antibiotics or together with antibiotics.   TREATMENT FOR ENTEROVIRUSES While most cases of aseptic meningitis are mild and last for just a few days with no sequelae, there are also some severe forms in immunocompromised patients and newborns which might benefit from treatment. One of the potential drugs that may be used in these settings is Pleconaril, but it is still under development (phase 3), so it is not available on the market yet.    MOLLARET’S MENINGITIS Mollaret’s meningitis is a syndrome that may be diagnosed simply by listening to the patient’s medical history56. It’s characterized by: -  Repeated episodes of meningitis, typically lasting 2-5 days, occurring weeks to years apart; -  Usually mild symptoms, including headache and photophobia; it may also be associated with disorientation and dizziness; -  Almost 50% of patients over time develop long-term neurological impairment, such as problems with memory, balance, coordination and/or hearing; -  25% of cases are caused by HSV-2 (but also HSV-1 and EBV have been detected in some cases), even in patients without a history of recurrent genital herpes; -  Treatment of acute episodes with acyclovir or valacyclovir, and, potentially, prophylaxis with valacyclovir (1000 mg/day).  Prophylaxis with valacyclovir is effective. The professor followed 2 patients who displayed a decreased number of episodes (only one over 2 years instead of one every 6 months) during the prophylaxis. Therefore, it may provide some benefits although there are no randomized clinical trials to actually support this hypothesis.    CHRONIC MENINGITIS Chronic meningitis is characterized by an indolent onset, a duration > 4 weeks and signs of inflammation in the CSF. Differently from recurrent aseptic meningitis (Mollaret’s syndrome), it does not present with several  55 The complete results are reported on slide 72. 56 Once a patient stopped the professor on the stairs and started telling him his medical history, and after roughly 5 minutes the professor was able to tell him that he had Mollaret's syndrome. 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   30 acute episodes, instead it develops indolently and chronically over time. It is also different from sequelae.57 In order to make a diagnosis, it is necessary to obtain an accurate history (travel, exposure to animals or foods), perform a neurological examination (which is usually abnormal), carry on with further tests according to the hypothesis and examination, such as skin biopsy, lymph nodes, eye examination, etc., and ask for a brain contrast-enhanced MRI. Sometimes even a brain biopsy has to be employed, giving an idea of how difficult it is to reach the diagnosis.  Fig.39 reports the infectious and non-infectious causes of chronic meningitis. One of them is chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in patients with agammaglobulinemia, a chronic viral meningoencephalitis by enteroviruses. Another possible cause is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, an autoimmune disease associated with choroiditis, chronic iridocyclitis, and alopecia. Some of these conditions are very rare, so a complete workout with the neurologist is necessary to get the diagnosis. [From the slides: In persons who are agammaglobulinemic, a chronic enteroviral meningitis or meningoencephalitis may develop and last several years, often with a fatal outcome; this syndrome has been designated chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in agammaglobulinemia (CEMA) CEMA is a constellation of neurologic symptoms that include headache, seizures, hearing loss, lethargy/coma, weakness, ataxia, paresthesias, and loss of cognitive skills. In about half of these patients, a rheumatologic syndrome, usually dermatomyositis, also develops, probably as a direct result of enteroviral invasion of affected tissues. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is presumably an autoimmune disease consisting of bilateral eye disease, chronic meningitis, and, later in the course, skin findings. Ocular findings are diffuse choroiditis or chronic iridocyclitis. CNS findings include headache, nausea, neck stiffness, tinnitus, and CSF pleocytosis. Alopecia, vitiligo, or poliosis occur later in the disease.]   57 From the slides. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   31 ENCEPHALITIS AND MYELITIS Encephalitis is defined as an inflammatory process involving the brain parenchyma directly - as it is actually an invasion from the meninges - and associated with clinical or laboratory evidence of neurological dysfunction.58 The distinction between encephalitis and myelitis is quite artificial, because there is not barrier, so bacteria or viruses can actually spread to the meninges and from them to the brain.    EPIDEMIOLOGY Encephalitis displays a low incidence, but the value can change a lot depending on the location, ranging from 2 to 7 cases/100,000 people/year59. It tends to be more common in children < 1 year old (13.7/100,000) and in elderly > 65 years old (10.6/100,000)60, and the incidence might be higher in certain epidemiological areas (e.g. Japanese Encephalitis61 in China and bordering countries).   IMPACT OF ENCEPHALITIS  The impact of encephalitis is relevant due to 3 particular features: ● Prolonged hospitalization: patients with encephalitis are hospitalized for a very long time and usually require admission to a post-acute rehabilitation setting; ● Mortality: 7-18% (not negligible); ● Disability: this is the most relevant problem, as it may reach up to 56% in certain cases. This means that roughly 10% of patients die, and out of the 90% who survive, more than half have a disability. So, the disability-free life expectancy is quite low.62  PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO ENCEPHALITIS The diagnosis is based on the presence of fever and signs or symptoms of CNS disease. However, it is important to make the differential diagnosis between the following conditions: -   infectious causes: encephalitis/meningitis and focal suppurative infections, such as brain abscesses and subdural empyema  -     ADEM63  -     Autoimmune encephalitis (encephalitis with no infectious cause) -     Encephalopathy    As can be seen in Fig.40, the diagnostic pathway starts with the triad of headache, nuchal rigidity and fever. If an altered mental status is also present, encephalitis, ADEM, encephalopathy, mass or abscesses should be suspected. Otherwise, meningitis may be considered, as patients with meningitis usually have a normal mental status. After this subdivision, the flow chart suggests a blood culture and to start empiric antibiotic therapy, followed by an MRI (or CT scan if MRI is not available) as soon as possible. Then, it is necessary to  58 This is a very broad definition. We will discuss a more pragmatic definition that be more helpful in the diagnosis. 59 These 2 values are the incidences in Finland and US respectively 60 The values in brackets refer to data from the US. 61 Japanese Encephalitis will be discussed in the future lessons. 62 The professor probably means that the YDLs (years lived with disability) is quite high, not that the life expectancy in patients without disability is low. As explained by prof. Massazza during the lesson on rehabilitation, “Years lived with disability (YLDs) are a measurement of the burden of disease. YLDs are calculated by multiplying the prevalence of a disorder by the short or long-term loss of health associated with that disability.” 63 ADEM: Acute demyelinating (or disseminated) encephalomyelitis 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   32 differentiate between mass lesion, ADEM and encephalitis in order to reach a definitive diagnosis.               \nDifferential diagnosis with encephalopathy Encephalopathy is defined as a diffuse cerebral dysfunction without associated inflammation. It may be due to toxins (e.g. alcohol, licit or illicit drugs) or metabolic dysfunction (e.g. hypoxia, hypo- or hyperglycemia64, electrolyte disorders65, renal or hepatic failure66, etc.).  For example, patients with severe hypoglycemia arrive to the hospital in a state of coma. This can be quite frequent in tropical countries, especially in children, and it may be due to malaria, malnutrition, diarrhea or the combination of 2-3 of these factors. One of the first things that should be done is measuring the glycemia, because it may be corrected, even if slowly.  Regarding the clinical features, fever, headache, seizures and focal neurological signs are not common in encephalopathy, while they are frequently observed in encephalitis.    64 Hyperglycemia may cause hyperosmolar coma. 65 e.g. hypernatremia 66 renal or hepatic failure in very severe cases may present with diffuse cerebral dysfunction but without the inflammation. \nFig. 41 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   33 Differential diagnosis with Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) In the case of ADEM, the radiological signs are different and sometimes might resemble focal lesions (e.g. as seen in Fig.39). ADEM is an acute demyelinating inflammatory disease of the CNS which usually appears with a delay of 1-4 weeks after an infection or vaccination. It is recognized in only half of the cases (50-60%). On the MRI, it is usually possible to appreciate diffused multicentric lesions in the white matter, which appear hyperintense on T2/FLAIR sequence (see figure on the right). In this type of images, the CSF appears black, so it can be differentiated from edema.  \nThe table above helps to differentiate between the clinical and laboratory findings of ADEM and of viral encephalitis. ADEM is common in young adults with recent vaccination and prodromal illnesses. There might be visual loss, usually without fever or with late-onset fever, which is instead common in viral encephalitis. There is usually no leukocytosis in ADEM. It is also possible to notice slight differences in MRI findings, such as white matter involvement in ADEM and grey matter in encephalitis (in both hemispheres). Furthermore, ADEM is usually gadolinium-negative. The CSF is similar in the two cases, so it’s not helpful. PCR instead can be used to make a correct diagnosis for viral encephalitis. If a brain biopsy is performed, different patterns of inflammation are observed: in ADEM there is mainly perivenular lymphocytic inflammation, while viral encephalitis presents perivascular inflammation mostly in the gray matter associated with neuronal and glial cell death, edema and viral inclusion bodies which suggest a viral etiology.   APPROACH TO ENCEPHALITIS - Quick diagnosis is important; some studies suggest that the delayed diagnosis of herpes encephalitis is associated with worse outcomes. -  MRI (if available) is better than CT scan (not so precise in defining the brain parenchyma) and should always be performed in patients above the age of 60, immunocompromised subjects, patients with other known CNS diseases67, seizures, focal neurological deficits68, or with signs and symptoms of raised ICP. -  CSF analysis: not only for all the normal paraments but also for viral PCR.  67 in order to understand if the clinical presentation is due to the previous disease or to a new problem. 68 in order to understand the cause behind the deficit, whether it’s due to a mass or to an inflammation of a specific area. \nFig.39  \nFig.40  \nFig. 42  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   34 -   Initiation as soon as possible of empirical acyclovir, which is the only antiviral drug routinely used to treat patients with encephalitis.   CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF ENCEPHALITIS Usually patients present a triad of fever, headache and altered mental status (this latter can be up or down, i.e. + or -, so patients can be psychotic or in coma). However, it is highly variable. Focal signs may also develop depending on the affected area: -      Hemiparesis -      Aphasia -      Ataxia -      Cranial nerve palsies -      Myoclonus (irregular and involuntary twitching of a muscle) -      Seizures -      Hypothermia (common in elderly) and loss of vasomotor control (autonomic dysfunction) -      Diabetes insipidus or SIADH may occur due to hypothalamic dysfunction    Fig.41 shows some clinical features that may help to recognize the correct pathogen. ● Parkinsonism, which includes bradykinesia69, rigidity and non-intentional tremors, is typical of West Nile Encephalitis ● Frontotemporal signs like aphasia, memory impairment and personality changes, are common in Herpes Viruses (mostly HSV 1 and HSV 6 and some forms of autoimmune encephalitis) ● Seizures are common in Herpes Viruses ● Brainstem signs like ataxia, ocular dysfunction, bulbar dysfunction (e.g. breathing and cardiovascular dysfunction), limb weakness, are typical of Bickerstaff encephalitis, which can be caused by Listeria, HSV, WNV, Enterovirus 71, Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE) ● Involvement of the anterior horn of the spinal cord presents with acute flaccid paralysis and it’s typical of Poliovirus but it is observed also in TBE and WNV.               OPERATIVE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA70 Altered mental status (decreased or altered level of consciousness, lethargy or personality changes) lasting for more than 24 hours, accompanied by at least 3 of the following associated manifestations: -      Fever >38°C within 72 hours before or after presentation; -      Generalized or partial seizures;  69 Bradykinesia: patients move very slowly 70 These criteria are used in studies. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   35 -      New onset of focal neurological findings; -      CSF white blood cell count >5/mm3; -      Abnormality of brain parenchyma on neuroimaging; -      EEG abnormality. Thus, at least 3 of these conditions plus altered mental status suggest the presence of encephalitis. Notice that fever may not always be present, and altered mental status may occur without all these associated signs.  Fig.45 shows several ways of entry of pathogens into the brain, already mentioned when talking about meningitis. -  (a) depicts retrograde axonal transport, which is usually employed by Herpesviruses, in particular HSV1 and HSV2, and VZV. These viruses can reactivate either in the skin or in the brain by following the axon retrogradely. For this reason, usually there are no skin lesions in patients with Herpes encephalitis and Varicella encephalitis, unless they are immunocompromised. In this case, there may be a subsequent viremia, although uncommon during reactivation. -  (b) depicts the BBB crossing, which may occur by crossing the endothelial cells either directly or indirectly (inside WBCs). It is usually observed in viral infections that give rise to viremia, such as WNV, VZV during varicella and measles virus, which is able to cross directly the BBB and enter the brain parenchyma. -  (c) shows the olfactory neurons, which represent a direct link to the external environment. This way of entrance is exploited by HSV and influenza viruses, which are able to cross the ethmoidal lamina cribrosa and enter the frontal lobes of the brain. -    (d) some pathogens are able to cross the blood-CSF barrier. CMV, for instance, has a tropism for endothelial and ependymal cells, thus it is able to cross them and enter the CSF. -   (e) Enteroviruses and mumps virus can enter directly into the CSF through the choroid plexus.   DIAGNOSIS  At least 3 sets of exams may be helpful in reaching the diagnosis: 1. MRI (brain imaging): it shows an increased signal on T2 and FLAIR sequences (diffusion-weighted more sensitive)71 and it might be more specific in some cases:  -     temporal lobe (frontal) and limbic system are typically involved in HSV and HHV-6  71 From the slides. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   36 infection, this is because HSV-1 has a trophism for temporal lobe; -    subependymal enhancement is seen in CMV infection (as mentioned before, CMV has tropism for ependymal cells); -     multifocal hemorrhagic infarctions are typical of VZV infection; -   demyelination zones are typically seen in VZV and JCV infection (it has to be differentiated from ADEM, which is gadolinium-negative)72. 2. CSF analysis  3. EEG73: not compulsory but might help in certain cases.  \n Fig. 46 Fig.46 depicts a MRI in HSV-E infection. These records belong to a 60-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, who was brought by her family to the emergency unit since she started presenting an altered mental status and lethargy. As visible in both T2 and FLAIR sequences, there is a hyperintense zone in the right temporal and frontal hemispheres. There is also some Gadolinium enhancement which suggests inflammation mostly in the gray matter of the temporal lobe.   CSF analysis is helpful because it shows pleocytosis74 (consisting mainly of lymphocytes, 50-500/mm3), normal glucose levels and slightly elevated protein concentration. In some cases, like in WNV infection, there might be a predominance of neutrophils. Remember also that the absence of WBCs does not exclude encephalitis, since <5% of patients have <5 CSF WBCs. Viral PCR is highly sensitive (>95%), however it’s better to perform a lumbar puncture as soon as possible because after treatment with acyclovir, the viral load decreases, and so the PCR sensitivity declines.  From the slides: Viral PCR highly effective (>95%) ● HSV PCR declines with treatment ● HSV PCR+ at 4-7 days (and neg early, rare) ● CFS IgM for VZV and for WNV (PCR less sensitive)  Fig.4775 shown below reports the several etiologies behind encephalitis cases. There are substantial differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.  ● HIV-negative patients: viral and bacterial infections account for almost half of the cases, followed by Lyme disease, fungi, Syphilis, Mycobacteria, Prions disease and Pneumocystis76. However, in almost 40% of cases the etiology is unknown, so there no diagnosis.  72 From the slides. 73 EEG: electroencephalogram 74 Pleocytosis: increase in white cells count 75 Most of the data reported come from the US. 76 The professor has never seen a case encephalitis due to pneumocystis in his whole life. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   37 ● HIV-positive patients: there is a predominance of viral and fungal (or parasitic)77 infections, while the cases of unknown etiology represent only 11%. \n A study performed by the California Encephalitis Project in 2003 and 2009 on immunocompetent hospitalized patients, reported a large amount of cases with unknown etiology (84%), although viral infection was still the most predominant cause, including HSV, WNV, EBV, CMV, VZV and Enteroviruses.  The patients were selected based on the operative diagnostic criteria78: presence of an altered consciousness/mental status for >24 hours and at least one79 of the following: fever, seizures, focal neurologic findings, CSF pleocytosis, consistent EEG or neuroimaging.  In females, below the age of 30, they had more autoimmune encephalitis than viral encephalitis. The therapy is very different between viral and autoimmune encephalitis. For viral we use antivirals while for autoimmune we use corticosteroids.  NGS AND METAGENOMICS At the moment the medical field is trying to implement the use of Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) and metagenomics in clinical practice.80 It would allow not to use target PCR but directly DNA extraction, fragmentation and sequencing. It could be very useful for DNA viruses, while it’s a little more complicated for RNA viruses. It would define the taxonomic profiling of everything present in the CSF of patients with  77 Toxoplasma, a parasite, accounts for up to 11% 78 These are common criteria. 79 This is what is written on slide 86, but it may be a mistake in my opinion, since it was previously said that the operative diagnostic criteria required at least 3 (not one) associated manifestations. In the recording the professor does not specify the number and just says: “altered consciousness >24h plus at least fever, seizures, focal neurologic findings, CSF pleocytosis, consistent EEG or neuroimaging.” 80 but there is no funding. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   38 encephalitis. It has already been employed in patients with encephalitis and chronic meningitis.  \nOn slide 101 the professor uploaded two papers81 which may be interesting to read to get an idea of the case study. In these studies, NGS was employed in patients with encephalitis and chronic meningitis, and the pathogens found in the CSF are shown in the colored column (“Pathogens Identified”) of Fig.49. While some are not surprising, such as HSV1 and Measles virus, others are really unexpected, such as astrovirus, arenaviruses and some cycloviruses, but it is unknown whether they are pathogenic or not. In fact, lots of viral genetic material can be identified through NGS, but it is not understandable whether these viruses represent the etiology of the disease. In any case it would be very interesting to use this technique in patients with no recognised causative agent. One of the most recent case studies which took place in a tertiary hospital in the US, reported that unknown etiology accounted for 30% of patients, viral etiology was predominant (48%), including HSV and VZV as usual, while autoimmune causes covered 22% of encephalitis cases.

California Encephalitis Project explained before).    Therefore, it is very important to know what autoimmune encephalitis is, how to diagnose it and how it can be treated (N.B. treatment for autoimmune is opposite to that for antiviral encephalitis).   Autoimmune encephalitis refers to group of recently discovered diseases characterized by: ● an autoimmune process with clinical symptoms affecting behaviour and cognition;  ● potentially reversible after immune-suppressive therapy or by removing the “antigenic source” (this latter is typical of paraneoplastic encephalitis);  ● characterized by specific autoantibodies,  ● it is important to distinguish between the two main forms: paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic. In the former, the source for the primary source is relevant since its removal will allow people to improve. In the table are listed different types of AIE divided by autoantibodies and their targets (intracellular antigens, synaptic receptors, ion channels and other cell-surface proteins).  Remember that in some cases the diagnosis of AIE may anticipate the diagnosis of cancer by many years (maximum is 8 years). Therefore, follow-up of the patient is very important.  An example the professor gave was that of a teratoma, which was clinically and radiologically evident 8 years after the first diagnosis of AIE.   Diagnosis The existing criteria for AIE are pretty complicated and is explained in the flowchart of fig.5482. The significant aspect to keep in mind is that clinical facts and evidence suggest that an early immuno-therapy improves the outcome. Therefore, the diagnosis of AIE should be as quick as possible. So, when a young patient comes to your attention with encephalitis, the first step is sampling a CSF (store some of it) and performing a viral PCR. If this turns out to be negative, the second step is to do an  82 The professor says to go through the flowchart to have an idea, but he didn’t explain it. He says he doesn’t want us to remember the single criteria. \nFig.52 \nFigure  SEQ Figure \\* ARABIC 1  figure.01  \nFig. 53  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   41 autoantibodies evaluation in the stored CSF as soon as possible to look for AIE.   1. Anti- NMDA receptor encephalitis Even if the specific diagnostic criteria for autoimmune encephalitis are not to be remembered, we should have an idea of what they are.  Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is the most common among AIE (fig.52) and it mainly affects young women, with a variety of symptoms that include those listed in fig.55.  \n Fig. 55 depicts the largest case (study, ed) published in Lancet Neurology in 2013. As it can be seen, behaviour and cognition disorders are present in almost all cases (nearly 100%). In addition, memory deficit, speech disorders, seizures and movement disorders are common and present in the vast majority of cases. In some rarer cases there can be loss of consciousness, autonomic symptoms or central hypoventilation83. Cerebellar  83 more common in adults. \nFig.54  \nFig.5\n5 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   42 ataxia84 and hemiparesis are very uncommon although not impossible. This is just to give you the spectrum of clinical manifestations.  For what concerns treatment85, we can see from fig.5 that there is an important difference in relapse rate when the patients undergo no treatment (25% risk of relapse) or are treated by immune-suppression with specific drugs (around 10% risk of relapse at 24 months).  So, in the end, you should immune-suppress them. The first line treatments include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), or plasmapheresis. While the second line immunotherapy treatments include rituximab and cyclophosphamide.  2. Hashimoto’s encephalopathy   This is a much more uncommon form of AIE, which is related to some extent to the presence of thyroid peroxidase and/or to thyroglobulin antibodies (but mostly anti-TPO) that can be detected both in the serum and in the CSF of the patient, even in patients with no previous thyroid pathology.   AIE AFTER HSVE   \n Fig.6 shows the most important paper published two years ago in Lancet Neurology. It was the description of a case series of neurological relapses or worsening of deficits in patients with HSV encephalitis, that in the whole literature have been described in up to ¼ of cases.  They tend to occur within the first 2 months of completing treatment with acyclovir.  In some patients, the symptoms of relapse are caused by reactivation or persistence of the herpes simplex virus, as shown by detection of viral DNA in CSF, but in other cases there is no effect of acyclovir.   The cohort study is a bit complicated, but briefly: some patients who were affected by HSV encephalitis later  84 more common in children. 85 not required to know in detail. \nFig.56  \nFig.57  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   43 developed AIE, and more specifically in most of cases Anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Then it’s required to follow up the patients for an extended time and to check for new symptoms, whilst also actively looking for anti-NMDAR antibodies early on (prognostic feature).  Bear in mind that several viral infections (including viral Hepatitis) might lead to the exposure of antigens causing the production of autoantibodies in predisposed individuals, thus leading onset of an autoimmune disease. For example, it has been shown that acute hepatitis, even those caused by minor viruses, may be the trigger for developing AIE over time.       SYMPTOMS The main symptom, especially in young children, is choreoathetosis, which namely is involuntary movements mostly in hands, a combination of chorea86 and athetosis87.88 (fig.58) \n In fig. 59, the different symptoms that occur are divided according to age of affected individual. As it can be seen, patients older than 4 y.o. present mostly psychiatric symptoms.   DIAGNOSIS The third diagnostic clue used in encephalitis diagnosis is Electroencephalogram (EEG).89 It is used for two reasons. One is because we want to see if there are some focal signs associated, but also because you can see a diffused slowing.  It shows generalized slowing (suggesting that whole brain parenchyma is affected) or focal abnormalities (sharp or spike activity, epileptiform discharges mostly in patients with seizures, but also in those without, being a negative prognostic feature). Depending on where these abnormalities are found, we can orientate ourselves toward different diagnoses since there is a typical lobe involvement.  • If the temporal lobes are affected in 75-80% of cases it will be an HSVE; • In case of anterior predominant slowing, it is most likely a West Nile Virus Encephalitis.   86 irregular migrating contractions 87 twisting and writhing  88 at this link on the slides you can see an example of choreoathetosis https://youtu.be/PDcr3PJlrBI  89 the first two being MRI and CSF analysis are explained before. \nFig.58  Fig.59  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   44 EEG can be used for confirmation, to study seizures and it is a minimally invasive of monitoring the evolution of the disease, even though some studies suggest a poor correlation of EEG with clinical evolution.  On slide 125 and 126  there is a list of minor viruses involved in the aetiology that the professor put for completion but that due to their complexity are not be covered nor asked.   DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Differential diagnosis among several pathogens or other causes is quite complex. Some of these etiologies will be discussed in the ADE such as Rhabdovirus, Helminths, Ameba… Bear in mind that vascular abnormalities might give symptoms similar to those of encephalitis. Some drugs may cause it e.g. CAR T-cell therapy; prions, etc.  - Culture-negative (Mycoplasma, Listeria, Ricketsia, Leptospira, Bartonella, Cryptococcus, Mucor, TB, Toxoplasma);  - Ameba e Negleria fowleri (PAM); Acanthamoeba/Balamutia chronic encephalitis (with granuloma) - Helminths (Strongyloides, Baylisascaris procyonis – raccoon, Toxocara)  - Rhabdovirus - Neoplasia - Vascular abnormalities - Abscess and empyema - Reye’s syndrome - Intoxication  - ADEM – Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis - Prions HERPES SIMPLEX ENCEPHALITIS (HSV-E) ● It’s the commonest cause of sporadic encephalitis (1:250K pop/year), accounting for 10% of encephalitis cases around the world. ● It has a bimodal presentation, with ⅓ of patients aged <20 years old and presenting probably a primary infection, in which instead of causing gingivostomatitis the virus reaches the brain causing encephalitis; and ⅔ of subjects who are >50 years old and present a reactivation, in which the virus doesn’t follow the normal route of skin involvement.  ● After the primary infection, there is a latency in the trigeminal sensory ganglion, after which the virus may reactivate, rarely through the tentorial nerves (cerebral fossa) or olfactory nerve.  ● At autopsies, patients with HSV encephalitis display a very high viral load in the CNS (olfactory bulb, hippocampus and brainstem). \n Fig.60 shows the typical symptomatology of HSVE. The most common manifestations are fever and altered consciousness, while headache, disorientation, seizures, personality changes, memory disturbances, etc. are less frequent. A clinical picture of fever, altered consciousness, headache and disorientation is present in \nFig.60  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   45 roughly 75% of the patients with HSVE.  As regards the treatment, there is a significant delay in the administration of acyclovir with respect to the presentation of symptoms (literature estimates 2-5 days). For this reason, the professor suggests, if the CSF is clear, to start directly with acyclovir (with an additional antibiotic) even before the results of the viral PCR are ready, as the treatment must be initiated as soon as possible. Then, if the PCR turns out to be negative, the drug may be withdrawn. Acyclovir is taken in doses of 10 mg/Kg every 8 hours for 14-21 days [depending on the results of diagnostic tests]90. The prognosis depends on:  - Age: mortality is low in children (11% if <2 y.o.), intermediate in adults (22% if 22-59 y.o.), and very high in the elderly (62% if >60 y.o.) - Level of consciousness, according to the Glasgow Coma Scale - Immune suppression - Duration of symptoms before the start of acyclovir  HHV-6  HHV-6 has been studied only recently before it was the cause of exanthem subitum (roseola) in children. However, a growing number of studies suggested that it could play a role in a lot of diseases so we don’t know yet what its pathogenic role might be. \nFig.61 shown a biopsy proving a lethal HHV-6 encephalitis after cord blood transplant.  In immunocompromised patients its role is established, while in immunocompetent subjects it is still debated. However, if you detect HHV-6 and cannot find any other cause, we suggest treating it with ganciclovir, rather than with aciclovir that is ineffective. - Two subgroups: HHV-6A and HHV-6B, that infect nearly all human beings (<2 yy). - Infancy is often symptomatic, resulting in childhood fever, diarrhea, and exanthem subitum rash (commonly known as roseola). Although rare, this initial infection can also cause febrile seizures, encephalitis or intractable seizures. - It has a life-long latency and can become reactivated later in life (transplant recipients).    90 From the slides.

An NINDS study found HHV-6 DNA in the CSF of 40% of 35 immunocompetent patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology (Yao 2009) HHV-6 encephalitis/encephalopathy associated with primary infection in infants has an unexpectedly poor outcome. In a nationwide survey in Japan, 46.9% of 81 cases resulted in neurological sequelae or death (Yoshikawa 2009) One study found that out of 983 cases of acute encephalopathy in Japan, 17% were caused by HHV-6.  64% of the severe cases with biphasic seizures in this study were attributed to HHV-6, only half of which survived without permanent neurological sequelae (Hoshino 2011)91  WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV)  Actually, it has nothing to do with the Nile, but origins from Uganda and it was discovered in the 30s. West Nile virus is a single-stranded RNA flavivirus, with different lineages92. It may infect several hosts including humans, birds, mosquitos, horses and other mammals. Hosts can be divided into amplifying hosts (including birds, which are does in which the virus can amplify), vectors and incidental hosts.  Vectors are mainly mosquitoes of many species mainly Culex spp. and Aedes spp., in addition the virus can also be transmitted by ticks in Asia and Russia. Humans, birds and other animals are incidental hosts. We talk about WNV because it is a growing epidemic and recently we have had many cases in Europe.  Fig.63 shows the latest available map of the US where there was an epidemic. They had cases since 1999 and reported 15,000 cases of neuroinvasive WNV with a mortality of approximately 4%. It is mostly localized in the center of the US and southern regions, due to the higher presence of vectors. \n 91 This paragraph in italics has been taken from the slides 92 “of which we don’t care much” \nFig.62  \nFigure  SEQ Figure \\* ARABIC 10  \nFigure  SEQ Figure \\* ARABIC 11  Fig.63  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   47 This map represents ECDC data.  Fig. 64 shows the incidence of WNV in Europe. At the end of the ‘90s, there were few cases in Eastern Italy but there has been a major spread in the East of Europe but also in Western Italy such as in Piedmont, in the South of France and in the center of Italy. In 2019, there were 463 cases in Europe (almost half of the cases in Italy, more specifically in the north-west region, like Piedmont) and 50 deaths. Case fatality was around 7-10% (73 deaths out of 1000). Last year there were many cases in Lazio and Sardinia.   CLINICAL PRESENTATION IN HUMANS There is a short incubation (2 to 14 day) and most of patients, like in flaviviridae infections, are asymptomatic (80%). This means that if we report a thousand cases of encephalitis, we will have 100,000 cases of asymptomatic West Nile, so the numbers will probably be huge and that is why we try to control the virus.  West Nile fever is present in 10-15% of cases in the most common form resembling influenza. Most infections resolve in 2-6 days. A minority of patient may present persistent fatigue.  West Nile Neuroinvasive disease is quite uncommon (approximately 1% of patients), even though a bit more common in those aged above 60. A paper93 suggests that one of the key receptors for WNV is CCR594 that is a co-receptor for HIV. It seems that patients with a CCR5 deficiency are at higher risk of having a neuroinvasive infection, therefore there might be some genetic involvement. Neuroinvasive disease can be severe and life-threatening. There are three syndromes: o Encephalitis (50-60%): tremors due to involvement of the basal ganglia (Parkinson-like presentation); o Meningitis (30-40%); o Acute flaccid paralysis (10%), like polio Half of the patients will have chronic neurological sequelae and the disease will be irreversible. [Persistent neurological dysfunction may occur (40-50% of cases)]  The problem is that we either control the vector or we do not know what to do, as it does not exist a vaccine to prevent West Nile.

Weakness may be associated with respiratory impairment from diaphragm or intercostal muscle paralysis; ○ Herpes viruses HSV2 in adults or VZV with shingles and focal myelitis: acute onset of paralysis in the legs (less commonly the arms), reduced or absent reflexes, or paradox hyperreflexia with extensor-plantar responses, decreased sensation, and decreased anal tone or urinary incontinence with sacral dermatome involvement; ○ Enteroviruses might be a common cause ○ HIV ○ Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) ○ Zika virus ○ Neuroborreliosis (Lyme) ○ Mycoplasma ○ Treponema pallidum  OTHER CAUSES  ● Neurosarcoidosis  ● Paraneoplastic syndromes  ● Systemic inflammatory autoimmune disorders that might involve the spinal cord:    ○ Ankylosing spondylitis  ○ Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ○ Behcet disease ○ Mixed connective tissue disease ○ Rheumatoid arthritis ○ Scleroderma ○ Sjogren’s syndrome ○ Systemic lupus erythematosus95        \n 95 taken from slides", "input": "", "output": "- intro\n    - CNS highly sensitive to infection >>>\n        - due to limited space & fragile structures\n        - so increase in volume (e.g. inflammation, mass) can cause rapid & severe complications\n    - cause of CNS infections >>>\n        - infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, helminths) are the primary cause\n        - some non-infectious conditions mimic CNS infections - e.g. cancer, autoimmune disorders, medications\n    - clinical presentation >>>\n        - variable depending on causative agent, location, patient factors\n        - can ange from acute (hours to days), to subacute or chronic (weeks to months)\n        - common symptoms: fever, headache, altered mental status (AMS)\n        - possible seizures\n    - differential diagnosis >>>\n        - crucial bc potential for rapid deterioration\n        - requires consideration of infectious & non-infectious causes\n        - using: detailed history, neurological exam, laboratory tests \n    - Neuronal regeneration >>>\n        - limited to specific areas (hippocampus, neuro-olfactory mucosa) - all others dont regenerate\n    - gray vs white matter >>>\n        - pathologies affecting gray matter (cortex) often cause seizures\n        - white matter pathologies may present with neurological deficits & seizures\n    - CNS anatomical barriers >>>\n        - lack of defined anatomical barriers between bran, meninges & spinal cord allows rapid spread of infection\n        - BBB - endothelial cells, pericytes & astrocyte end-feet - protecting brain parenchyma from blood-borne pathogens & toxins\n        - Blood-CSF barrier - located in choroid plexus - less restrictive than BBB;

Malaria 2. Arboviruses  3. Bacterial infections  4. Hemorrhagic fever  In the end, we’ll go through a brief introduction to rare diseases.  There is an increasing number of people going abroad for tourism and other reasons, indeed the international tourist arrivals reported in the graphic in Fig.1 reports that since 2010 people’s mobility has increased, with the only exception of 2020-2021 due to COVID-19.   \nTRAVELER’S HEALTH RISK The increase in incidence can be caused by: 1. Frequent flights: the number of travelers has increased massively in recent years. 2. VRFs (Visiting relatives and friends) are defined as the traveling of people born in tropical countries that then went living somewhere else and went back to their own country for the purpose of VRFs. These people are at higher risk because for two main reasons and the first one is malaria. Malaria does not give a permanent immunity, you can get it a thousand times in your life, but if you get malaria a lot of times before the age of 5, you get a sort of immunity, called premunition, that allows you to have almost no symptoms in case you get it again in your life. However, if then they go away from their origin country and you T cells are not used to react against malaria anymore, you lose the premunition in about 3 years.   The second reason is that when they go back to their country, they stay in areas of the city in which the risk for contracting a disease is higher, whereas travelers usually stick to visit touristic/commercial areas.  3. Medical tourism increased in certain countries, such as India for the purpose of plastic surgery and Turkey for hair transplant.   Out of 100.000 travelers to resourceless settings for one month, half of them will develop some health problems and one will die. Calcagno’s advice is “try not to be that one”.  Bear in mind that infections make up only 2% among the causes of death in travelers (Fig. 2). They cause a great number of comorbidities but have low mortality. More common causes of death are traffic accidents, cardiovascular issues, suicides, psychiatric problems and violence.  The most important infection people can have when traveling to tropical countries is traveler’s diarrhea (20-40%), it is not so severe because of hospitalization, but people can get dihydrated. Other risks are respiratory viruses, influenza etc (see Fig. 2 on the right). The message is, when you have a patient that has just came \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n2 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi back from tropics, do not think just about malaria, but also to other diseases.  There are other risks to the traveler: - Accidental injury \n- Environmental hazards  - Animal bites, stings and envenomation. Dangerous animals are jellyfish, snakes and spiders. For example, the most dangerous animal in Australia is a special kind of jellyfish that can induce the death of the people that has been stung. If a snake bites someone, you have to follow the “RIGHT” criterion: R=reassure the patient, I= immobilize, GH= go to hospital, T= tell the doctor. It is also useful to take a picture of the snake, if possible, in order to allow the doctors to recognize it and know immediately which treatment is better to use. Indeed, some snakes have a neurotoxic venom that must be removed from the body as soon as possible. Anyway, only a small number of snakes have neurotoxic venom and just a little part of them can inject enough venom to be dangerous.  - Crime and assault - Psychiatric problems - Dermatologic disorders - Mountain sickness (>3000 mt).  RISK STRATIFICATION AND PRE-TRAVEL VISIT - Reason for travel: it is usually associated to certain risks. - Duration of travel: certain vaccinations are suggested only for more than one month; expatriates that were born there but then changed their habits by moving to other countries and lose their immunity. It is important also to pay attention to the season, if it’s dry, wet.  - Budget: to understand the type of vaccination the traveler has (complete= high budget, incomplete= low budget) \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n3 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi IMMUNIZATION TO CONSIDER FOR ADULT TRAVELERS  Usually, doctors suggest being vaccinated for Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis Measles/Mumps/Rubella/Polio but also for: - Hepatitis A which is usually suggest for most of travelers - Hepatitis B for all the non immune patients  - Typhoid fever, the vaccine is not that effective, it covers between 50-70% of strains. There are two vaccines, an intramuscular one and an oral one. - Yellow fever, it is a live vaccine, nasty, that gives a lot of fever, and it is suggest just for selected countries  - Cholera, usually done if there is an epidemic in the country. The vaccine we have now works nicely, covers also for a certain percentage of other pathogens that cause traveler’s diarrhea such as E. Coli. - Japanese Encephalitis, suggested for people that stay for more than one month in South-Est Asia, South of China and Japan and that stay outdoor or if they work with animals. This disease affects ticks, mosquitoes, animals and humans.  \n  The graph in Fig. 5 shows the international tourists’ arrival. It can be seen how many tourists travel from rich resource countries to low resource countries every year, which is approximately 1 billion. According to some studies, it can be concluded that among the diseases that are not present in Europe, 92% are linked to tourism and 8% to migration.   The second important point in tropical disease, apart from the increase of travels to endemic countries, is the \nFig.  \nSEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABI\nC 4 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n4 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi presence of vectors.  Indeed, tropical diseases spread mainly through vectors. Vector changes can affect the spread of such diseases, for example Fig. 5 shows how changes in the presence of Aedes Albopictus in Europe, accompanied with climate changes such as temperature and humidity, has affected the spread of Chikungunya (this lead to small outbreaks of Chikungunya in Italy, a few years ago).  The third important point is that these diseases travel with humans. Change of location due to traveling will also change the clinical presentation according to genetic background and climate changes. For example, the Zika virus was discovered in Uganda. Then it moved to the East resulting in outbreaks in the Pacific Islands. Afterward, the virus reached South America which led to the discovery of the association of Zika with CNS conditions such as microcephaly and some other brain abnormalities in children born from an infected mother. The other discovery was that this virus is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. It’s not known exactly why this difference in clinical presentation occurs, but it’s related to genetic differences between populations. In addition, last month in France a case of Zika virus was reported in which the affected man hadn’t been traveling outside Europe which suggests the presence of the virus in Europe.   Another example is the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever, a severe disease, mainly transmitted by tick bites and droplets. In 2016, a Spanish man was reported to be affected: he presented fever, altered mental status then shock followed by death. The nurse that was taking care of him also got infected and survived.  Furthermore, 5 years before this reported case, scientists discovered the presence of ticks vectors and infected birds in West Spain. The virus can also be transmitted by birds, which migrate from the Middle East to Spain, carrying the virus and transmitting it.    Another aspect is the possibility of developing epidemics. Every tropical country is at risk of an epidemic. For instance, the outbreak of plague in Madagascar in 2017; the plague is mainly spread by infected fleas and presents firstly in a bubonic form, which can, however, evolve into a pneumonic one. The change in the plague form indicates a human to human transmission of the disease. Therefore, in the second part of the epidemic, there was an increase in pneumonic plague cases, due to transmission between humans. This epidemic was controlled by isolation.  The Ebola epidemic in Congo was much harder to control. This epidemic caused more than 3000 cases with around 2000 deaths. The number of cases was much lower than those in West Africa but it was much harder to control due to the highly populated and smaller area as well as political aspects (war episodes nearby). This epidemic was finally managed thanks to the large efforts made, such as isolation and widespread use of vaccination.   FEVER IN RETURNING TRAVELERS Fever is the most frequent condition reported in travelers coming back from tropical areas.  It’s very important to investigate and rule out potentially deadly contagious diseases and treat curable illnesses. \nFig.  SEQ Fig. \\* ARABIC 5 \nFig.  \nSEQ Fig. \n\\* \nARABIC \n6 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n5 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi This indicates the importance of past and recent medical history, that helps in: 1. Determining the source of infections, exposure and incubation period. For example, malaria has an incubation time that goes from 6 days to 6 months maximum, so you need to understand when the symptoms started, the duration of the fever, if this person was exposed to certain sources of infection such as fresh water.  2. Signs and symptoms (such as fever duration) 3. Vaccination and prophylaxis (ask about compliance!) 4. Ask also if some other people in the group had the same symptoms   In the last 15 years in Turin we had only 2 suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever, one due to the epidemic in West Africa and the other one was a very strange story. Some researchers went to Nepal to collect ticks and one of them came back with very very high levels of AST, ALT and fever; two days after he started bleeding from the GUT.   For example, if fever begins after more than 21 days from returning, it’s unlikely that the patient got infected with dengue, rickettsial infections, viral hemorrhagic fevers such as yellow fever and Lassa fever.   DIAGNOSTIC FLOW  It is the usual investigation for travelers. 1. Thick and thin smear (useful to rule out malaria because it’s a deadly disease) 2. Complete blood count 3. Liver function test 4. Urine analysis  5. Hemoculture, stool (it can tell something about parasites and Salmonella) and urine cultures (rule out UTI, Traveler’s diarrhea...) 6. Chest X-ray to exclude upper and lower respiratory tract infections 7. Serologies (Dengue, Rickettsia, Schistosoma, Leptospira, and acute HIV infection)  INCUBATION PERIOD Different diseases have different incubation periods, and this helps physicians to rule out certain conditions.  - Incubation period can be less than 2 weeks and present with fever associated with (Fig. 7):   1.

Other tropical countries affected by malaria are South and Central America and Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, in which resistance is common). Malaria is very common in terms of morbidity. On the good side, there is a decreasing trend in mortality of malaria, thanks to various prevention methods that have been employed in recent years.  \n Every year the WHO presents data (Fig. 9) about how many people presumably had malaria, it is an estimate, and also how many people died for it. About 250 000 people every year experience malaria, and if compared to the year 2000, the number has not changed so much.  On the contrary we have reduction in mortality, from 860 000 in 2000 and 608 000 in 2022.   Looking at the countries in which we have malaria (Fig. 10), all the red ones are in Africa, but we also have cases in Pacific regions, America, Mediterranean regions. Talking about Africa, the incidence is so high because Plasmodium Falciparum is mostly based there.  The prevention efforts for malaria actually work. Indeed, between 2000 and 2010, malaria incidence rates and mortality fell to 50%.          \nFig.  \nSEQ Fig. \n\\* \nARABIC \n9 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n7 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi  These prevention methods include indoor spraying to help in reducing the number of mosquitoes bites; the effect can be enhanced by spraying just before the wet weather season. Another prevention tool is impregnated bed nets containing a toxin that kills mosquitoes. These bed nets have a life span and they need to be replaced because they get damaged and the effect of the toxin (pyrethroids) is reduced over time. However, these nets are still effective in reducing the number of mosquito bites per person, which is also due to the fact that often mosquitoes bite at a specific time of the night (dusk and dawn).  The third prevention tool is the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy, a drug combination given orally. One of the drugs is artesunate, a quick and effective drug acting against both parasites and gametocytes, the sexual form of malaria plasmodia. Since gametocytes are the ones picked up by the mosquito, their death reduces the transmission of the disease.  These preventive methods require lots of effort and money, but they are important as they actually do prevent malaria, their impact is huge.   EPIDEMIOLOGY Malaria is a disease of tropical countries. Malaria's most severe form is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The highest incidence is found in Africa, some cases in South America and Asia.  Outside these areas, other Plasmodium types are found, such as Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale, which cause a less severe form of the disease and with lower mortality.  These (Fig. 12) are the countries which are certified malaria-free, and we can notice that in 2021 also China has been certified malaria-free.  \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n8 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi  PLASMODIUM, VECTOR, HOST Malaria transmission requires 3 elements: a Plasmodium, a vector, and a host. Each of these might change over time affecting the transmission of the disease.  - Plasmodium: Plasmodia are protozoa and there are five known species that might affect humans, which can be morphologically distinguished with thin and thick blood smears (discussed later in the lecture)  1. Plasmodium falciparum, that causes severe malaria. 2. Plasmodium vivax 3. Plasmodium malariae, less relevant from a clinical point of view 4. Plasmodium ovale, possibility of having hepatic forms that can stay in the liver forever causing relapses over time, every 6 to 12 months. 5. Plasmodium knowlesi, which can also cause severe malaria, it was thought to be just for the chimpanzee, but now we know that it can affect humans too. In the last 3 years we saw an increase in Asia, Malesia and Panama and probably we’ll see more cases in the next future.   The plasmodium life cycle is pretty complex. Malaria infection starts when the mosquito bites a human injecting the sporozoites in the bloodstream. Those sporozoites migrate into the liver where they replicate and infect liver cells and develop into schizont which, after 7 days, when they are all synchronized at the same stage of maturity, rupture the hepatocytes and reach the bloodstream infecting red blood cells.  P. falciparum can infect RBCs in all their forms, while P. vivax and P. ovale can infect only erythroblasts causing lower parasitemia. What can be seen in the blood of patients infected with malaria is the presence of trophozoites (ring stage: ring near the cell border) after RBCs infection. Here the symptoms start, when trophozoites break RBCs causing fever, anemia etc. Trophozoites can develop into mature trophozoite, and this cycle is repeated as the mature trophozoite can form schizont. In certain cases, schizonts migrate to the liver and result in liver stages again.  P. vivax and P.ovale  have liver stages that can persist up to months and years. In addition, the mature trophozoite can form gametocytes (sexual forms of plasmodium). During the mosquito blood meal, when the mosquito bites an infected person, it ingests the gametocytes, resulting in sporogonic cycle inside the mosquito, mostly in salivary glands. The cycle is repeated when the mosquito bites another human.  \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n9 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi  \n- Vector Mainly Anopheles mosquitoes, existent in 20 different species that usually bite from dawn to dusk. These mosquitoes are anthropophilic and zoophilic, meaning that they can bite humans but also other animals. Those mosquitoes are endophilic, they prefer to inhabit and rest indoors (they usually prefer rural environments). Transmission is influenced by several factors including the longevity of the vector, temperature, humidity and altitude, indeed they do not fly above 1100 mt. Anopheles stephensi is an effective vector of P. Falciparum and P. vivax, we recently known that it is relevant for humans and it comes from Asia and Arabian Peninsula. It is able to resist very high temperatures and has also high resistance to insecticides.    - Host Host resistance is related to genetics, as certain genotypes can favor resistance to malaria. For example, having sickle cell anemia, thalassemia or G6PD deficiency, which are basically alterations in hemoglobin and other enzymes within RBCs, is protective against malaria as this condition affects RBCs. Newborns are protected against malaria up to 6 months of age due to the presence of fetal hemoglobin, maternal antibodies, breastmilk, and lack of primed T cells (for this reasons malaria in newborns is absent/not severe).  IMMUNITY  !!!DO NOT ASK FOR SEROLOGY FOR MALARIA AND TUBERCOLOSIS!!! The only case in which we can ask for serology in case of malaria is when people want to donate blood and they are just came back from an endemic country.  Immunity is not based on antibodies, but on T cell priming by plasmodia antigens.   1. Clinical immunity: no or mild symptoms despite circulating parasites (parasitemia). It develops after several infections and within the first years of life in high endemic areas. Patients can come to clinics \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n10 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi only with headaches and they turn out to be actually infected with malaria. 2. Anti-parasite immunity develops later in life (more than 10 years of age) and requires a high parasite rate. Typical of adults in highly endemic areas having low parasitemia and no symptoms.  These two types of immunity might be lost if the patient migrates and moves to an area with low endemicity. If the patient comes back to his original area he may develop a severe form of malaria.      Fig.14 is taken from a study published on The Lancet, about whether massive drug administration was effective or not. In this study, people from 4 villages in Vietnam participated, then ultrasensitive PCR was performed in all subjects in order to understand whether there has been a low level of replication during the massive drug administration. The uPCR results indicated lots of low levels of plasmodium replication, some of P. falciparum, others of P. vivax , and in 25% there were co-infections with both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Specifically, a persistent low level of replication with some peaks was observed. These peaks were not associated with symptoms and what could be concluded is that persistent largely asymptomatic plasmodium infections are common in some areas, which proves the presence of clinical and anti-parasite immunity in such places.   In addition, it’s important to tackle malaria infections, as it was thought that Vietnam had low seasonal malaria transmission although some subjects have a persistent malaria infection for a duration of almost one year. \nTRANSMISSION Malaria has two transmission patterns: 1. stable transmission pattern is found in high endemic areas where the transmission is stable during the year. Children and pregnant women are at a higher risk. This transmission pattern is harder to control as it requires to control many hosts all year round. 2. unstable transmission pattern is found in low endemic countries. Malaria infection can occur at every age. This pattern is a seasonal transmission found in South East Asia, in which there is low malaria immunity and a potential epidemics may develop because there is no widespread protection against malaria. This transmission can be controlled, as happened in Italy before malaria was eradicated in the XX century, it was a summer transmission malaria rather than a stable one.  INCUBATION TIME It ranges from 7 to 30 days and varies among species, shorter for P. falciparum and longer for P. malariae. Prophylaxis can delay the onset of symptoms. In case of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, symptoms may appear after months especially with prophylaxis, due to hypozonite forms of these species. This means that prophylaxis might be able to tackle the first infection, but it may appear months later. The individual is considered to be at risk of developing malaria up to one year after travelling to an endemic country, hence in order to rule out malaria the patient must be tested for it.  \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n11 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi CLINICAL PRESENTATION - Non-complicated malaria The classic malaria presentation is rarely observed.  The malaria attack lasts 6-10 hours and presents initially as cold and chills, subsequently with high fever, headache, vomiting, massive sweating with defervescence and deep asthenia.  The malaria attack occurs every two days for P.falciparum, P.ovale and P.vivax (tertian fever) and every 3 days for P.malariae (quartan fever). Both are rarely observed nowadays, and the fever timing is due to the synchronized breakdown of the schizonts with merozoites and trophozoites release into the bloodstream, followed by RBCs attack.  Usually, malaria clinical presentation is a combination of fever with chills, sweating, headache, general malaise, nausea, vomiting and widespread pain (much less classic). Anyway, do not expect to see always fever because people take drugs to lower it down.   Signs and symptoms 1. High fever 2. Sweating 3. Weakness 4. Splenomegaly can be a chronic condition referred to as tropical splenomegaly that develops after several malaria infections.  Fig.15 shows an 11-year old child with massive splenomegaly (more than 25 cm, it gets to the iliac spine) in Burundi. This causes chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, the spleen is extremely big making it able to destroy lots of circulating RBCs and platelets  5. Hepatomegaly 6. Jaundice, if there is a massive destruction of RBCs 7. Tachypnea, in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a compilation of malaria.  To sum, the presentation of malaria includes headache (present in 95% of cases), with fever and chills.   Lab tests will show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP and ESR with normal WBCs (this is how we differentiate with Dengue that usually shows leukopenia). Liver function test will show increased AST, and creatinine as well. There won’t be lymphopenia, that is an important distinction between malaria and Dengue.  - Severe malaria Severe malaria is due to P. falciparum infection in 99% of cases, and to P.vivax and P. knowlesi in 1% of them. In high endemic areas it affects children below the age of 5, while in low endemic ones it mostly affects adults.   Criteria for severe malaria: 1. Cerebral malaria  2. Severe anemia 3. Haemoglobinuria 4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS 5. Spontaneous bleeding  and/or DIC 6. Shock 7. Acute tubular necrosis (microvascular obstruction) 8. Hyperparasitemia (>10% of infected RBCs) \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n12 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi 9. Metabolic acidosis  10. Hypoglycemia (can be due to malaria itself or to drugs such as quinine), especially in children because Plasmodia use sugars leading to coma  In severe malaria, the therapy moves from oral to intravenous administration.  CEREBRAL MALARIA It’s not common and usually affects children. Cerebral malaria is defined as an altered state of consciousness with very common seizures and coma in a patient with parasitemia and no other cause of brain involvement (including meningitis, sepsis, hypoglycemia, rabies, hypertensive encephalitis, trauma, etc). Cerebral malaria has a high mortality rate, around 20-50%, and leaves neurological sequelae which are very common in children (more than 40% of cases) and quite rare in adults (<10% in adults).  Cerebral malaria is judged according to Glasgow common scale or the Blantyre coma scale.  \nThe pathogenesis of cerebral malaria is not completely clear. It’s not encephalitis, nor a parasitic infection of the brain, we won’t find an infection in the brain, there are no plasmodia there, but rather it is a vascular problem caused by several mechanisms such as obstruction of microvessels in the brain and plasma leakage outside the vessels. Basically, there is a combination of altered blood flow with increased vascular leakage causing brain damage, it is a kind of diffused cerebral ischemia because RBCs with plasmodia inside obstruct the local circulation. The resulting damage is partially reversible which is why neurological sequelae are higher in children.  There is nothing we can do; the only thing is to treat it as soon as possible in order to limit the damage.   Patients affected with cerebral malaria is seen in Fig. 17, as shown he is suffering from neurological complications and coma and by looking at the patient’s conjunctiva the presence of severe anemia can be concluded without running lab tests.  \nFig.  SEQ Fig. \\* ARABIC 16  13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n13 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi  \n PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Pathophysiology consists of destruction of RBCs thus developing anemia. This causes the parasite and RBC products to be released into the bloodstream triggering the host reaction, meaning that immunity has a big role and may lead to complications. Indeed, patients having a kind of degree of immunity don’t overreact and thus don’t develop severe malaria, hence the risk is higher for children and non-immune hosts (travellers ed.). Being filled with P. falciparum, RBCs are deformed, tend to stick to each other forming a peculiar structure named rosette (aggregation of RBCs and platelets), which may occlude some vessels. This is another mechanism that causes microvessel damage, thus interfering with blood flow and also result in metabolic interference (like in the liver).  Another complication of malaria associated with P. falciparum infection is blackwater fever. It’s an intravascular hemolysis with immune/allergic pathogenesis.  Patients who are already on treatment may present sudden onset of fever (>40 degrees), chills, lumbar pain, jaundice, oliguria and anuria, and dark urine (coke color).  Lab tests will show hemoglobinuria due to tubular and persistent renal dysfunction.  In addition, blackwater fever is facilitated by quinine, so in this case it’s suggested to switch to another treatment.   Nephrosyc syndrome is another rare but severe complication of malaria with late diagnosis. It’s associated more with both P.malariae and P.falciparum than the other Plasmodia. This renal complication is characterized by high loss of proteins in urine and edema in the face. It’s even more severe in malnourished children who already have low protein concentration in their blood.  MALARIA DURING PREGNANCY Mostly P. falciparum → severe forms in mothers (severe anemia) and causing negative pregnancy outcomes (premature delivery, abortion, low birth weight and neonatal death)  Malaria during pregnancy is a special case that can occur in two settings: ● high transmission setting with partial immunity, usually mothers are asymptomatic, with/without parasitemia and with anemia. Parasite presence in the placenta leads to low birth weight. It’s higher in first pregnancies, except for P.vivax that has higher risk in successive pregnancies.  ● low transmission setting, anemia is very frequent, increased risk of severe malaria and may lead to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and other negative pregnancy outcomes like prematurity and low birth weight.  \nFig.  \nSEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABI\nC 18 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n14 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi  The WHO recommends a package of interventions for prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy, consisting of: 1. the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets while sleeping (LLINs) 2. in all areas with moderate to high malaria transmission in Africa, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), this prophylaxis is suggested every trimester.  3. prompt diagnosis of malaria and effective treatment of potential episodes.  DIAGNOSIS  1. Think of malaria in patients who have recently travelled to endemic countries and presenting with seizures, fever and headache (7 days to 6 months P.vivax) 2. Examination (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice, paleness). 3. Thick smear detects the presence of the plasmodium and provides a quantitative assessment, i.e. plasmodia number in comparison to RBCs (giemsa stain). 4. Thin smear is more accurate in number calculation and to differentiate between species of plasmodium (P.Falciparum, P.ovale, P.vivax). The differentiation of species is not easy for trophozoites, it’s easier in the presence of schizonts and gametocytes instead (May-Grunvald or Giemsa). 5. Antigen rapid test with chromatographic methods, it is useful, quick and cheap. 6. PCR, for certain settings and very rich countries, very sensitive. 7. Lab test (haemocrome, LDH, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine, glycemia, haemogas analysis with lactate).  Thick blood smear: one drop of capillary blood is placed on a glass slide, using the corner of another slide spread it and stain with Giemsa. The thick smear shows granulocytes and ring-shaped trophozoites.  A thin blood smear is a drop of blood that is spread across a large area of the slide, it allows to see the RBCs with the trophozoite inside. Thin blood smear helps to count precisely and differentiate the species.   Another technique is using fluorescent dye, more expensive and hence less employed.    Rapid Diagnostic tests RDTs, referred to as cassettes, are lateral flow immunochromatographic antigen detection tests. There is one common antigen shared by all four species and one falciparum-specific antigen, they can even be dosed in combination to detect the species. It is cheap, quick and sensitive, but it stays positive for a few weeks, so if a patient gets reinfected with malaria, you’re not able to differentiate. Moreover, now we have a mutation in the genome of the plasmodium and so this test gives a lot of false negative results (20%) which do not recognizes this mutation.   TREATMENT  There are different drugs with different effects and specific for different stages.   - Artemisinin and derivatives  This group of drugs derive from a plant known as Artemisia annua. It has been used in China for \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n15 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi hundreds of years.  These drugs include artemisinin, artemether, artesunate and dihydroartemisinin (effective moiety). Some of these are administered orally, other intramuscularly and other IV. All of these drugs can have rectal administration, which is used especially in children before getting to the hospital as an attempt to reduce the time to the first dose of antimalarial drug in high endemic countries. These drugs are very quick in killing schizonts and trophozoites resulting in rapid reduction in the parasitic load, the estimated reduction is about 10.000 parasites/48 hours thus reducing the mortality in severe malaria. These drugs are also able to kill gametocytes reducing the number of plasmodia and inhibiting the establishment of a second cycle in mosquitoes preventing them from infecting other subjects.  The duration of this treatment is 7 days if used alone or 3 days if given with long half-life compounds (such as lumefantrine, amodiaquine, piperaquine, mefloquine, pyronaridine). The combination of these drugs (artemisinin and derivatives) with a long half-life compound is known as Artemisinin based Combination Therapy (ACT), which is the standard therapy for non-severe malaria everywhere in the world. It may change according to local availability, resistance patterns of companion drugs etc., yet still remains the gold standard treatment for malaria.  Side effects: generally, these drugs are well tolerated, but GI intolerance, QT prolongation, type 1 hypersensitivity reactions may happen, and there are no safety studies in the first trimester of pregnancy, hence others are employed.   AQUAMAT study: children with severe malaria were randomized and received artesunate vs quinine. A decrease in mortality in artesunate was shown with the administration of artesunate. A meta-analysis of RCTs confirmed this, hence this study changed the WHO policy regarding which drug should be used, and if WHO guidelines changes, everywhere in the world should be able to provide ACTs.   - Quinine Not used much nowadays, because it was mainly replaced by ACTs (which showed reduced mortality rate). Quinine is still used in certain conditions such as the first trimester of pregnancy. It must be administered with slow infusion to avoid risk of developing hypotension and arrhythmias.  It has many side effects including tinnitus, nausea and hypoglycemia.  - Chloroquine Used to treat non-P.falciparum uncomplicated malaria, it has some side effects which are usually well tolerated.   - Amodiaquine: Similar to chloroquine. Effective on chloroquine resistant strains of P. falciparum, used in association with artesunate derivatives ACTs.   - Sulfadoxine/ Pyrimethamine   - Mefloquine:  Used mainly for prophylaxis. It has a long half life of 21 days thus some drugs cannot be administered after mefloquine administration.  It has side effects such as QT prolongation, as well as sleep disturbances (nightmares and vivid dreams), psychoses and depression (in almost 10%). Whoever experiences mefloquine side effects will not take it again.  13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n16 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi - Primaquine: It is important because it seems to be the only drug effective against hypnozoites. Therefore, in case of P. ovale and P. vivax infections, after treating the acute episode, primaquine must be administered to reduce the risk of relapses overtime.  It’s also effective against gametocytes (P.falciparum).  As it regards the prophylaxis, we only have 2 drugs, Malarone (atovaquone  and proguanil hydrochloride) which is taken every day, expensive and can give GI disturbances and Mefloquine, taken once a week, generally well tolerated by 90% of people, but for the remnant 10% severe side effects such as psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, psychosis).   CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING ANTIMALARIAL TREATMENT 1. Plasmodium specie  2. Geographic area (including resistance, rate of mixed infections P.ovale P.vivax etc) 3. Severity of clinical presentation – severe malaria is usually treated with intravenous drugs or if you do not have them intramuscular drugs, non-severe malaria is treated with oral drugs (combination of Artemisine and a second drug). 4. Previous prophylaxis/treatment 5. Comorbidities and concomitant conditions (long QT, unable to swallow, etc) 6. Local availability of drugs that may change in different scenario  TREATMENT OF NON-COMPLICATED MALARIA: 1. P. falciparum:  ACTs orally, in case of severe vomiting or risk of complicated malaria, drugs can be given Intramuscular (IM) or Intravenously (IV). 2. P.malariae or P. knowlesi: chloroquine. 3. P.vivax or P.ovale: chloroquine + Primaquine. In countries with widespread chloroquine resistance, ACTs is indicated (such as Indonesia, Peru, Oceania)  TREATMENT OF SEVERE OR COMPLICATED MALARIA Start with IV or IM artesunate or artemether for at least 24 hours and when the patient can tolerate oral medications complete treatment with ACTs for 3 full days.  Resistance to ACTs This is a concerning point. Resistance has already started in Southeast Asia. Plasmodium gene mutations suggested that there may be a selection of mutants that make artemisinin less effective. The presence and development of these mutations are checked worldwide, together with the rate of failure of ACTs seen in Fig.21, the high rates of ACTs failure are found in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam. These have been exposed to several antimalarial drugs for many years and this led to the selection of plasmodia resistant to antimalarial drugs. That’s why there is no effective prophylaxis for patients traveling to these countries.  Basically, resistance to Artemisinin is due to 2 proteins that allow hemoglobin to get into the hepatocytes; if Hb cannot get inside, Artemisinin is not activated and so cannot act. In this case, the mutation allows less Hb to get inside the hepatocyte and so the efficacy of the drug is much lower.    SUPPORTIVE CARE 1. Antibiotics in case of bacterial infections 2.

Inotropic drugs for shock 4. Oxygen and ventilation in case of ARDS 5. Antipyretics 6. Glucose administration in case of hypoglycemia 7. Treatment of seizures in case of cerebral malaria 8. Careful fluid balance is really important. For example, as in Dengue infection, there’s fluid leakage out of the vessels and the risk of edema, especially pulmonary edema, is very high. Fluid balance must be kept at minimum for the maintenance of circulation without having risk of edema.  PREVENTION OF MALARIA 1. Vector control: environment control and indoor spraying 2. Personal prevention with the use of ITN (Insecticide Treated Nets) and repellent. 3. Chemoprophylaxis: suggested for travellers and VRFs. Prophylaxis depends on the scenario, according to the season, duration of travel and resistance in the area. Pre-travel consultation is suggested in a travel clinic in order to decide the type of prophylaxis.   Travellers and VFRs  . Mefloquine or atovaquone/ proguanil (Malarone) and doxycycline  . No prophylaxis if resistance is reported (go to hospital within 12 hours of fever).  Intermittent Preventive Therapy (IPT) suggested in high endemic areas with different scenarios:  . Second and third trimester of pregnancy in high endemic areas  . Children in high endemic areas (3 doses together with routine vaccination)  . Seasonal malaria chemoprevention in certain areas   This is a way of reducing the number of malaria episodes and lowering the clinical consequences.   There are two main concerns worldwide: ● resistance to antimalarial drugs and repellents that may reduce the efficacy of both insecticides-treated nets and repellents. ● how to control malaria. Resistance for malaria prevention can also happen. For example, pyrethroids resistance has been demonstrated in certain countries (repellent resistance seen in Fig. 22)  Fig. 23 A model developed by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine shows that the usage of indoor sprays and nets in Kenya causes a reduction in malaria. However, a plateau is reached after certain limits. In order to reduce and possibly eradicate malaria furthermore, other strategies are needed.    Mass drug based strategies for malaria elimination  ● Population wide drug based strategies ● Mass drug administration MDA ● Focal mass drug administration FMDA (only in local populations, in certain groups) ● Mass screening and treat MSAT or Mass test and treat MTAT  \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n18 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi  These aggressive strategies might potentially lead to malaria elimination.  Currently, the use of ivermectin is being studied. Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that is used to treat strongyloidiasis and other helminthic infections. However, it’s also effective in killing mosquitoes: when this drug is found in the blood, the mosquito’s life expectancy is massively reduced thus lowering significantly the mosquito’s opportunity to transmit malaria to other individuals.   A study suggested the use of oral ultra-long-lasting drug delivery toward malaria elimination goal. This is a capsule that dissolves and deploys a star-shaped dosage form that releases the drug it was loaded with while assuming that geometry. The star tips are linked by pH-dependent bridges, once the capsule is in the stomach these bridges open turning the capsule into star-shaped dosage form that resides in the duodenum for several days releasing slowly ivermectin. Ivermectin is released for several days and when a mosquito bites the person in that time frame, a reduction in its life expectancy will occur thus reducing the number of vectors favoring malaria elimination.  MALARIA VACCINE To date, an approved vaccine against malaria does not exist yet, but only an experimental vaccine (RTS, S / AS01) against P. Falciparum in phase 3. This study was published 3 years ago: 8922 children and 6537 infants were vaccinated with 3 or 4 doses. 4 doses efficacy was 36.3% for malaria, and 32.2% for severe malaria (low efficacy) and in young infants the efficacy was even lower (25.9% for malaria and 17.3% for severe malaria). The low efficacy is still better than nothing as it’s more urgent in some areas and it was more effective in some areas compared to others. Three countries in Africa (Malawi and other two) launched a vaccine program which will provide a large-scale data on how protective the vaccine is for severe forms of malaria.  The target is not malaria per se, but severe malaria. Results came out last year, in which the protection was around 1 life saved over 200 vaccines in children.  In conclusion, last year WHO added malaria vaccine in the suggested ones for people going to topical countries. We will probably have more effective vaccines in the next future, such as the one published on the Lancet 3 years ago, which is shown to be more effective in terms of immunity and also protection.   ARBOVIRUSES (DENGUE, ZIKA, CHIKUNGUNYA)  These three viruses are quite similar, we can have a slight differentiation between them: - Dengue generally develops with very high fever and all the other symptoms reported in Fig. 25 - Zika has high rush presentation - Chikungunya presents especially arthralgia      1. DENGUE VIRUS \nFig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n25 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n19 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi It is a Flavivirus (arbovirus) transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that, in comparison to Anopheles mosquitoes, usually bite during daytime and prefer urban (but also rural) environments with small amounts of water e.g. small pawns or artificial containers for water.  3.9 billion people are at risk and there are 390 million cases per year. Low mortality (2.5% for severe dengue), 4.000 -12.000 deaths per year. Hence, the overall mortality rate is low but still epidemics caused by the virus are important for healthcare systems because many patients need to be assessed. Seasonal epidemics are found in some countries such as Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  Local transmission in France and Croatia in 2010. Meaning that the virus is present in Europe and comes mainly through travelers. Thus, it is very important to report the presence of people with Dengue infection in order to prevent its spread to the vector and then from the vector to other patients.   There is a global increase in the number of cases in many countries in the world, but mostly in America. A substantial reduction in mortality is demonstrated due to the fact that severe dengue like the hemorrhagic fever and shock are now treated. Thanks to treatment, the mortality has reduced from 20% to 0-1%. However, Dengue hemorrhagic fever has still a substantial mortality above the one reported before (0-1%) that indeed includes severe and non-severe cases.  GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION Dengue infections are widespread in most tropical countries such as Southeast Asia and South America [fig. 2].  Several countries in Africa have high presence of Dengue too, but infections are very limited there. This is potentially due to the presence of co-infection of dengue-malaria. The geographical distribution of dengue is similar to that of malaria.  The dengue virus has 4 different serotypes widely diffused. The massive people travelling who are infected with dengue lead to the distribution of these serotypes in the last 30 years.  CLINICAL PRESENTATION The incubation is short (4-7 days, ranging 3–14 days). The clinical presentation often includes leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.  The majority of patients will just present: ● fever ● “classic” Dengue, which is characterized by fever, headache, arthomyalgias, lymphadenitis (50%), and there might be a rash (diffuse or maculopapular rash or even petechiae Fig. 26). It is important, if a patient presents these symptoms from March to November, even in Europe, to test him for Dengue.  Only a small number of patients have the severe form of Dengue that can cause the death of the patient if not treated: ● Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) DHF usually develops in 1% of patients. It is rare among travelers, but it is more common in patients with previous infections with different serotypes (so it is an immunity-based reaction) and in those living in \nFig.  \nSEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n26 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n20 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi endemic areas. DHF consists of fever, hemorrhages and severe thrombocytopenia (<100k). ● Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)  MORTALITY Mortality in classic dengue is very low <1% (hemorrhages in peptic ulcer carriers). In DHF it is 20% without treatment, which lowers to 1% when intensive supportive therapy is provided; therefore, it is a controllable situation. For this reason, it is common to see warning posters among hospitals in the affected endemic. Such posters alert the population about persistent vomiting and spontaneous bleeding, which may suggest DHF and the need to seek medical care.  DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis is different among primary and secondary dengue infections. Diagnosis is made on antibodies. Figs. 27 represent the “kinetic” of IgG (in green), IgM (in red), the virus i.e. Dengue RNA (in white), and the early antigen NS1 (in yellow). NS1 is really important, it is very rapid and sensitive. The Dengue RNA is positive only during the first 5-6 days, so it is quite hard to find (and it is also expensive). Therefore, the common diagnostic path includes a combination of IgG, IgM, and antigen. The latter is quick to measure, thus providing a rapid and sensitive test used to diagnose Dengue. Secondary Dengue infection differs from the primary infection because of the IgG have a much higher titration and the very small increase in IgM.  Serological Markers Primary dengue infection: ● IgM (5 days after symptoms) ● IgG (7 days after symptoms) ● RNA (only for the first 5-7 days after symptoms, while it persists in urine and saliva for 14 days) = useful for serotype identification ● Antigen NS1 (rapid diagnosis and sensitive) Secondary dengue infection: ● IgM (low titer and for few days) ● IgG (rise quickly, high titer) ● RNA ● Dengue RNA and NSA1 antigen \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n21 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi Tourniquet test The Tourniquet is part of the new WHO case definition for Dengue; it is a marker of capillary fragility and can be used as triage tool to differentiate patients with other acute gastroenteritis, for example, from those with Dengue.  How perform a tourniquet test? ● take the patient’s blood pressure and record it ● inflate the cuff to an average pressure between SBP and DBP and maintain it for 5 min ● reduce and wait 2 minutes ● count the petechiae below the antecubital fossa [fig. 28] ● the test is positive if >10-20 petechiae per square inch.  The combination of a positive tourniquet test and lymphopenia is highly suggestive of dengue.  If you have a patient with Dengue, you have to evaluate him every 4 hours in terms of pressure, hematocrit and hemoglobin, infuse fluids and plasma or RBCs in some cases in the first 2 days.   DENGUE CONTROL There are some objectives [fig. 8], regarding dengue control, related to the reduction of mortality, morbidity and burden of disease – all of which are hard to control since it is a viral disease and is often underreported. There have been problems with the vaccine: despite the effective beginning, malignant problems causing an increase in mortality arose in specific scenarios. There have also been legal problems as the Philippines decided to use the vaccine even if the WHO was contrary to it (because of the warning signs and related deaths) – indeed, some children were vaccinated and after 3 years, when they got infected with Dengue, they developed the most severe symptoms and eventually died.  Up to date, no vaccine is legally available yet.  2. ZIKA VIRUS “I don’t want you to be an expert in Zika virus”. For Zika Professor wants us to remember just 2 things:  - Risk of brain malformation for the fetus if it is contracted during pregnancy  - It is associated with proximal ascending paralysis - Guillain-Barré syndrome  Just take a look at the slides.

CHIKUNGUNYA Have a look at the map in fig. 30: Chikungunya is widespread now and its largest diffusion occurred after 2013 (it is quite recent). A Chikungunya outbreak has been detected in Central Italy (in Anzio) in 2017, because of a local transmission by a carrier.  It is transmitted by Aedes mosquitos and has a short incubation period (4-7 days). The clinical presentation is a little different from the other arboviruses infection, as three clinical phases can be distinguished: ● ACUTE PHASE (up to 10 days): arthritis, cutaneous rash, cardiovascular/neurological/renal/ocular manifestations ● POST-ACUTE PHASE (4-12 weeks): symptoms (mostly arthritis) are slowly fading but chronic asthenia and chronic pain persist ● CHRONIC PHASE (after 12 weeks): chronic or long-lasting symptoms (they may last up to years), often with painful resurgence in the most commonly used joints, because of their inflammatory state after the infection  Treatment for the chronic phase includes acetaminophen, tramadol, or codeine (no NSAIDs, no corticosteroids), but it is still not clear how to treat it properly.  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE ARBOVIRUSES There are no great differences in the clinical manifestations of the three Arboviruses, but the most common reasons for medical consultation may vary: ● Dengue = fever, myalgia ● Chikungunya = joint pain, fever ● Zika = exanthema or pruritus Referring to the evolution to chronic form: there is no chronic form in Dengue, and it is not described in Zika, but is very common in Chikungunya. All of these characteristics are relevant for the differential diagnosis. However, at the end, the usual procedure is to rule out Malaria and Dengue and, if they are negative, proceed with a serological examination for Zika and Chikungunya.  BACTERIAL INFECTIONS (RICKETTSIAE, ENTERIC FEVER)  Bacterial infections can be the reason for a medical consultation after coming back from the tropics. 1. RICKETTSIAE \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n25 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi There are several species of Rickettsia: ● African tick-bite fever (R. africae) ● Boutonneuse fever (R. conorii) ● Rocky Mountains fever (R. rickettsii) ● Scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi) ● Murine typhus (R. typhi) ● Epidemic typhus (R. prowazekii)  They are all transmitted by different vectors (ticks, mites, lice, and fleas), which may also reflect the geographical differentiation.  CLINICAL PRESENTATION  In general, all species of Rickettsia manifest with fever, headache, myalgias; they have an abrupt onset. Other signs include: ● conjunctival suffusion ● regional lymphadenopathy ● generalized rash (except African form) also palmoplantar ● leuco- and thrombocytopenia ● painless escara (R. conorii 🡪 “tache noire”)  When dealing with these patients, it is important to investigate if there were any recent travel in camping areas, forests, hiking, or trips in grassy areas (e.g. strict contact with nature). This should be the first warning sing. The second most important warning sign is the presence of a painless escara (called “tache noire” if caused by R. Conorii), which a typical lesion shown in fig. 31.  DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT ● suspect of any recent camping site, hikers and safari in grassy areas  ● clinical presentation ● serological confirmation The treatment of choice is usually Doxycycline.  2. ENTERIC FEVERS (Typhoid and Paratyphoid) Salmonella typhi (and paratyphoid A and B) is transmitted by oral-fecal route through contaminated water, food, vegetables, seafood. It has an exclusively human reservoirs, with chronic carriers having it in their intestine and gallbladder. There are some hyperendemic areas (India, Philippines, Latin Americas).  CLINICAL PRESENTATION The classic definition of typhoid fever divides the clinical course into four 7-days periods (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks), which are characterized by different clinical presentations. It is a kind of sepsis, because Salmonella disseminates in the blood, organs, and tissues. The disease has an insidious onset, really abrupt, after 10-14 days of incubation period. Patients usually \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n26 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi present fever and headache with few other clinical signs, which might be: ● abdominal pain, constipation, rarely diarrhea (“pea puree” in children) ● sometimes leuko- or thrombocytopenia, dry cough, lymphadenopathy The high-grade fever is accompanied by a relative bradycardia. The patient might be in a typhoid status (i.e. confusion, altered mental state) and present some rose spots [fig. 32], which are groups of 10-15 pink blanching papules (little bumps) on the anterior trunk (between nipples and umbilicus), 2-8 m, last 3.5 days. Possible complications are GI bleeding, perforation, sepsis, abscesses.  All of these elements: exposure in tropical countries, insidious onset with fever, and other certain features may make you suspicious of enteric fevers.  DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT Diagnosis is not easy because even if there is a serology (the famous Widal serology) it is not a proper diagnostic exam given the high number of false positives and false negatives. Cultures are the preferred diagnostic examinations: hemoculture (2nd-3rd weeks), stool cultures (1st-3rd weeks), and, in certain cases, cultures of the bone marrow.  Treatment: ● Fluoroquinolones, 3rd generations cephalosporins (mostly ceftriaxone), azithromycin. ● Ceftriaxone (10-14 days). ● in case of severe systemic illness: dexamethasone (3 mg/Kg followed by 1 mg/Kg every 6 h for a total of 46 h). ● There is an orally administered vaccine that is partially protective (70-80%), therefore it reduces the risk of having a severe form of typhoid fever. This vaccine is suggested to travelers in endemic areas.  HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS (including Yellow fever)  The differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever is with Neisseria meningitidis (Meningococcemia), malaria, leptospirosis e rickettsiosis, that can all lead to hemorrhages. The most classical forms of hemorrhagic fevers are caused by RNA viruses: ● Filovirus (Ebola – mortality 30-50%, Marburg - mortality is 80%) ● Arenavirus (Lassa mortality 40-50%, Guanarito, Machupo, Junin, Sabia) ● Bunyavirus (Rift Valley fever, Congo-Crimea, Hantavirus) ● Flavivirus (Dengue, Yellow Fever and other Asian hemorrhagic fevers)  Transmission: there can be directly transmitted viruses and arthropod-borne viruses.  For this lecture, the focus will be on the transmission routes and the required protection for health care providers. For instance, Ebola is transmitted by droplets but sometimes patients get so sick (vomiting, diarrhea, coughing) that the transmission/exposure is difficult to avoid –they release so many infectious droplet nuclei that the infection becomes somewhat airborne [fig. 33]. Therefore, doctors must wear specific protections, but it is so difficult to work in those conditions that they are forced to change in less than an hour; moreover, undressing (as well as dressing) can be quite long because there are strict instructions to be followed.  \nFig.  \nSEQ Fig. \n\\* \nARABIC \n32 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n27 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi EBOLAVIRUS PERSISTENCE ● Sporadic EVD cases continued to appear outside of this window and several reports strongly suggest that these unexpected re-emergences occurred due to viral transmission from persistently infected EVD survivors. ● Male survivors should continue to practice safe sex for at least 12 months after the onset of symptoms (WHO, 2016b). Viral recrudescence outside of the male genital tract (MGT) can also develop after filovirus infection, as initially observed in 1977 for a single case of Marburg virus uveitis (Kuming and Kokoris, 1977).  ● During the West African outbreak, recrudescent cases were again observed within the eye, and also the CNS several months after initial infection (Jacobs et al., 2016; Varkey et al., 2015).  1. YELLOW FEVER The frequency of yellow fever is now reducing, but it is still a cause of disease and it may cause hemorrhagic symptoms. It is caused by a Flavivirus (a small single-stranded RNA+, enveloped and antigenically conserved virus – indeed, it seems to be similar worldwide). It is transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes in three different scenarios: ● Sylvatic (jungle) yellow fever: in tropical rainforests, monkeys are the primary reservoirs of yellow fever. They are bitten by wild mosquitoes that pass the virus to the other monkeys. Occasionally humans working or travelling in the forest are bitten by infected mosquitoes and develop yellow fever. ● Intermediate yellow fever: semi-domestic mosquitoes (those that breed both in the wild and around households) infect both monkeys and people. Increased contact between people and infected mosquitoes, leads to increased transmission and many separate villages in an area can develop outbreaks at the same time. This is the most common type of outbreak in Africa. ● Urban yellow fever: large epidemics occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high density of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination or prior exposure to yellow fever. In these conditions, infected mosquitoes transmit virus from person to person.  Fig. 34 shows the most recent maps representing the countries at risk. They are mainly located in the tropical areas of Africa, but there are also other areas that, despite only having a partial outbreak, require vaccination prior travelling (e.g. South and Central America) – this is because they are trying to eradicate yellow fever. There has also been a yellow fever outbreak in the coastal area Brazil in 2017, so they are considered at risk. A modelling study based on African data sources estimated the burden of yellow fever during 2013 was 84-170k severe cases and 29-60k deaths per year – i.e. there is a slight reduction, but it is still a high number. \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n28 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi  CLINICAL PRESENTATION, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT Alike other arboviruses, the incubation period is short (3-6 days). ● Acute phase: fever with concomitants symptoms (chills, headache and myalgias, nausea, vomiting, relative bradycardia). ● Toxic phase (only 15%): after defervescence, fever reappears with jaundice (that is why it is called “yellow fever”: there is a hepatic toxicity with hyperbilirubinemia), abdominal pain, and vomiting. During this phase hemorrhagic symptoms may appear e.g. “black vomit”. The toxic phase has a much higher, mostly due to renal failure – which is the most common and more severe complication. ● Complications: renal failure, myocardial dysfunction, CNS involvement, pancreatitis.  Mortality accounts for 20-50% of cases and is usually due to its complications.  DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis is achieved through a combination of serology and PCR (although the latter can turn out positive only during the first days, so it should be performed early).  TREATMENT There is no specific treatment (only supportive care), while vaccine is effective – that is why a lot of strategies to control yellow fever rely on vaccinations.  Vaccination: Live-attenuated and life-long protection from day 10 (a booster dose is not needed i.e. a single dose is protective). ● In high-risk areas where vaccination coverage is low, prompt recognition and control of outbreaks using mass immunization is critical. It is important to vaccinate most (80% or more) of the population at risk to prevent transmission in a region with a yellow fever outbreak. However, there might be severe adverse event following immunization (AEFI). Apart from the fact that is painful, patients could develop liver and renal toxicity, which are not that common but specific groups of patients are at higher risk, thus are excluded from the vaccination.  TRYPANOSOMIASIS, FILARIAE, HYPEREOSINOPHILIAS AND LEISHMANIASIS – exotic tropical diseases  Fever with neurologic involvement may be caused by different pathogens, here is the differential diagnosis:  ● meningitis and encephalitis ● malaria ● extrapulmonary TB ● typhoid fever ● rickettsiosis ● poliomyelitis ● rabies ● leptospirosis ● African Trypanosomiasis ● Japanese Encephalitis  These last two are the most typical ones (they will be discussed in the ADE - EMERGING BUGS AND 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n29 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi TREATMENTS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES).   1. CHAGAS’ DISEASE - AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS It is an infection caused by Trypanosoma Cruzi, mostly transmitted by Triatomine bugs (“kissing bugs”), however other possible transmission routes are: ● vertical  ● transfusion and transplant ● ingestion of contaminated food or drink (e.g. cane sugar contaminated with Trypanosoma feces) ● laboratory exposure. It is found mostly in America (expanding from southern US to north of Chile, with highest burden in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Guatemala). The estimated prevalence accounting for 6 million people (high prevalence).  LIFE CYCLE When a bug feeds on a human (i.e. it bites to take a “blood meal”, as seen in fig. 35) it usually defecates. The feces pass trypomastigotes that penetrate several cells at the bite wound site; inside the cells they transform into amastigotes, which multiply. Intracellular amastigotes develop again into trypomastigotes, which burst out of the cell and enter the bloodstream, potentially infecting other cells and transform into intracellular amastigotes in new infection sites. Once in the blood trypomastigotes can also be transmitted to another bug.   CLINICAL PRESENTATION ● ACUTE TRYPANOSOMIASIS Acute trypanosomiasis is usually a mild disease, just a small percentage (>1%) of patients are actually diagnosed, indeed it is usually asymptomatic. The incubation period is of 1-2 weeks (longer for transfusion/transplant – up to 120 days). Patients might present signs at portal entry, such as Chagoma sign (fig. 36 on the right, a round rash around the bite site) or Romaña sign (fig. 36 on the left, monoliteral swelling of one of the eyelids). They can also have fever, systemic symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis, and (rarely) meningoencephalitis and myocarditis. There usually is such a high level of parasitemia that is possible to see Trypomastigotes on Giemsa stained thick and thin blood smears (Fig. 36 at the bottom), but PCR is much more sensitive thus is preferred for diagnosis.  ● CONGENITAL INFECTION \nFig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n36 13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n30 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi Congenital infection is uncommon, just in South America. It is similar to acute form, affecting 5-10% of newborns from infected mothers. It is mostly mild or asymptomatic and is diagnosed by cord or neonatal blood (smear + PCR).  ● CHRONIC INFECTION Chronic infection is highly variable, but the two most important forms are: ● cardiomyopathy: presents conduction system defects, arrhythmias, apical aneurysms; the most common form is a dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure, which usually causes SCD. Some of the patients require transplantation because of heart failure.  ●  GI dysfunction: the destruction of enteric neurons during acute infection results in severe organ enlargement, mainly involving the esophagus and colon: ● Megaesophagus: causes dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, regurgitation, aspiration. ● Colon: chronic severe constipation and fecalomas formation. ●  Treatment: benznidazole, nifurtimox  2. HELMINTHS INFECTION-HYPEREOSINOPHILIA Among the causes of hyper-eosinophilia there are Helminth infections. Diagnosis requires 3 stool samples and serology for some of the helminths that can be found in the stools, such as Strongyloides, Toxocara, Trichinella. The latter is the most typical one; it causes muscle pain, fever, GI symptoms and hyper-eosinophilia. It usually presents in clusters, as it happened this past year with a few patients in Val di Susa who ate wild boar salami and presented with all these symptoms.  SOIL TRANSMITTED HELMINTHS ● Ascaris lumbricoides [800 million - 1.1 billion] ● Whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) [600-800 million] ● Hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus) [570-740 million] ● Strongyloides stercoralis [30-100 million]  Soils transmitted Helminths are relevant for the health of millions of children in limited resources settings – have a look at the above numbers of estimated prevalence around the world. They are transmitted from soil and can cause chronic intestinal infections with chronic anemia and may affect neurodevelopment – so they may cause substantial problems in the development of those children. There are various NGO programs that try to tackle malnourishment: one of the things that is usually done, apart from assessing the malnutrition, is deworming of children.  Some examples of parasitic infections caused by soil transmitted Helminths are: ● Larva migrans, caused by Hookworms, which usually presents in the feet [fig. 37]. You do not see it moving because it is kind of slow, it does 1 cm/day. ● Asymptomatic but causes anemia! \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n31 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi ● Pruritus, dry cough ●  ● Larva currens, caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, which is a much quicker larva that coils under the skin [fig. 38]. ● Malabsorption and abdominal pain ● Hyperinfection in immunedepressed hosts ● Serology!  ● Ascaris lumbricoides (Fig. 39) ● Often asymptomatic ● Risk of bowel obstruction ● Dry cough     3.  SCHISTOSOMIASIS A particular case of fever with hyper-eosinophilia is Schistosoma infection, called snail fever. Schistosoma is a Helminth that is usually acquired when swimming in contaminated water (e.g. lakes of endemic areas), indeed it penetrates in the skin from a lesion. They are usually very “romantic”, the male lives around the female to protect her and they live in fresh water.  There are different species of Schistosomes that have different organ and tissue tropism: ● S. mansoni, usually causes chronic liver problem; ● S. haematobium localizes in the bladder giving chronic problems in the urinary tract; ● S. japonicum; ● S. mekongi (in south-east Asia). It is a relevant infection: it is estimated that more than 200 million people have it. Areas at risk are mostly localized in Africa, but also South East Asia and South America.  CLINICAL PRESENTATION ● The most limited clinical presentation is cercarial dermatitis (called “swimmers’ itch”), due to cercariae penetration into the skin, nothing serious [fig. 41] ● after that, cercaria can migrate into the gut, resulting in intestinal schistosomiasis (granulomas → polyps, protein loss, malabsorption, strictures) ● the parasites can further migrate into other locations causing chronic infections with chronic consequences (15 years after infection): ● migration to the liver causes hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, which leads to portal hypertension → ascites, varices, splenomegaly, but normal hepatic function ● migration to the bladder causes urinary schistosomiasis, resulting in hematuria, chronic \nFig.  \nSEQ Fig. \n\\* \nARABIC \n38 \n13.05.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.13   \n32 Allegra Zogheri, Luca Polizzi infection, obstruction ● others (cardiopulmonary, CNS, etc.)  ● ACUTE FORM: Katayama fever is an acute inflammatory syndrome that manifests 3-8 weeks after the cercariae infection. It includes high fever, cough, general malaise, and hyper-eosinophilia. It is a hypersensitivity reaction that heals without treatment (granulomas).  CONTROL OF SCHISTOSOMIASIS Suggestions for prevention are, of course, to avoid swimming in lakes in endemic areas. However, there are some problems for the control of Schistosomiasis, which is obtained through a Massive Drug Administration (MDA) to the target population (children 6-15) in the attempt of reducing the burden of Schistosomiasis and its long-term consequences on liver and bladder.  4. FILARIASIS Different types of filariasis exist. Even though their incidence is lowering, they can still be found in some areas of Sub-Saharan Africa.  ● Lymphatic Filariasis, causes massive lymphatic edema in lower limbs (where vectors i.e. mosquitoes usually bite). Vectors are Aedes, Culex, and Anopheles. ● Loa Loa, transmitted by flies and usually resides in the conjunctiva (mango/deer fly: Chrysops)  ● Onchocerciasis, transmitted by black flies (black fly: Simulium) that can cause blindness or skin psoriasis (chronic lesions in the skin).", "input": "", "output": "- Malaria\n    - ## Malaria\n        - **epidemiology** >>>\n            - Endemic in: subsaharan Africa, Asia, South America\n            - Transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes\n            - High-risk populations: children, pregnant women\n        - **Pathophysiology**: >>>\n            - Caused by  *Plasmodium*  species - primarily  *Plasmodium falciparum, but also P.ovale, P.malariae, P.vivax*  \n            - Vector: Anopheles mosquitos ( and a human host)\n            - Resistant Host if: Sickle cell anemia, G6PD def., thalassemia, newborns up to 6 months\n            - incubation 7-30 days (even more in plasmodium malariae)\n            - The lifecycle begins with the mosquito injecting sporozoites into the bloodstream ⇒ which migrate to the liver (can stay there for years) ⇒ multiply ⇒ and then infect RBCs ⇒ leading to their destruction\n        - **Clinical Manifestations:** >>>\n            - onset up to months after infection!\n            - Symptoms include: fever, chills, sweating, headache, nausea, and vomiting\n            - Severe cases can lead to **cerebral malaria**, **severe anemia**, and **acute respiratory distress syndrome, Blackwater fever** \n            - Signs include **splenomegaly** and **hepatomegaly** \n        - **cerebral malaria** >>>\n            - altered state of consciousness up to coma\n            - ↑ mortality\n            - neurological sequelae\n        - **Blackwater fever** >>>\n            - sudden high fever onset\n            - Intravascular hemolysis\n            - lumbar pain\n            - jaundice \n            - dark urine / hemoglobinuria\n        - **complicated vs uncomplicated malaria** >>>\n            - Uncomplicated malaria: mild symptoms, no organ dysfunction, treatable with oral medications\n            - Complicated malaria: severe symptoms, potential organ failure, requires intravenous treatment\n            - Symptoms of uncomplicated: fever, chills, headache, sweating\n            - Symptoms of complicated: severe anemia, respiratory distress, cerebral malaria\n            - Diagnosis: blood smear, rapid diagnostic tests for both types\n        - Transmission >>>\n            - Through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes - primarily active during dusk and dawn\n        - **Diagnosis**: >>>\n            - Thick and thin blood smears to identify the parasite\n                - Thick: quantitative assesment, thick smear not much spread\n                - Thin: to accurately differentiate between species\n            - PCR\n            - Fluorescent dye\n            - rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are also available\n        - Treatment >>>\n            - First-line treatment includes Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) for non-severe malaria - oral, IV, or rectal\n            - Severe cases require IV \n            - Experimental vaccine\n            - Ivermectin - antiparasitic drug\n            - supportive care;

They can be both observed in severely immunocompromised people but not in young healthy males. This (Fig. 1) is the usual presentation of PCP: bilateral infiltrate in the interstitium of the lung with a brown appearance and acute lung injury. There is a progressive dyspnea, which could lead to intubation since lung insufficiency could be deadly.  Kaposi’s sarcoma is an angiosarcoma related to the infection by Herpes Virus A. Normally, Kaposi’s sarcoma is present in severely immunocompromised individuals affecting the lower limbs. In these cases instead, the lesions are observed everywhere (skin, mucosa, GI tract, and lungs). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was biopsy-confirmed at 3 different hospitals in Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles and San Francisco were the two most relevant cities for the beginning of the epidemic in the US. All 5 patients were also positive for CMV (cytomegalovirus) infection, candida mucosal infection, and Kaposi’s sarcoma. The mortality at that time was about 90% because no treatment was available.  In 1983 the disease was named Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The mortality was really high: 90% of people diagnosed with AIDS died in the first 6 months. It was a severe pandemic. Since 1984 there has been exponential growth of cases without the availability of serological tests, at that time the only diagnosis was a clinical diagnosis with all the pitfalls such a complex clinical picture implies. In 1985 two different groups, Montagner/Barré-Sinoussi (France), which received the Nobel prize, and Robert Gallo (USA), identified and isolated the virus, obtaining also the first images of the virus.  For a long time, it was not compulsory to notify any case of HIV infection and this increased even more the extent of the diffusion. During the same year, after the isolation of the virus, the first IgG serological test was developed.  The first case in Italy occurred in 1985 in IDUs (injecting drug users) and hemophilic patients.  In the same year, the heterosexual transmission was confirmed. In 1987 the first drug against HIV was released: zidovudine (AZT). It has been tested for cancer since it is a thymidine analogue, so it can impact DNA synthesis. Side effects were linked to the onset of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy and for these reasons it was discarded. It was repurposed as an antiretroviral drug since it can selectively inhibit reverse transcriptase, which is one of the key enzymes of HIV replication (the virus uses the enzyme to make a DNA copy of its RNA).  In several African countries, the first test was done in 1995, so for 10 years the diagnosis of HIV has been clinical-based (weight loss, chronic diarrhea, chronic lymphadenopathy). Q: What IDU’s stand for? A: Intravenous Drug Users (reference to the slides). These events have been followed by a worldwide diffusion of HIV/AIDS. A huge increase in cases occurred especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (more than 80% of cases) countries, where HIV/AIDS had a tremendous impact in terms of life expectancy and economic burden. \nFig.1  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 2 At the beginning of the ‘90s HIV/AIDS was the first cause of death in people aged 25-29 years old.  In those years the disease was considered by the general population only associated with drug abusers and homosexual people and so the real risk of the diffusion was underestimated.  To inform and sensitize people, many commercials were created. The main message of the commercials was “If you know AIDS, you avoid it. If you don’t, you die”. This message was useful but really scary. This contributed to the creation of stigma towards infected people.  Many famous people were infected and died because of HIV, while others decided to talk about it (Fig. 2). Freddie Mercury, Bruce Chatwin, Rudol'f Nureev, Isaac Asimov, Majic Johnson (the first NBA player who openly talked about HIV), and Keith Haring (who died because of HIV). \n     This picture (Fig. 3) is really important: Professor Aiuti from Milan was an immunologist, who here kisses a patient (who is still alive) on the lips. The message is that it is possible to touch, kiss, and live with somebody who has HIV. Because many people were scared even to touch HIV-positive people. Someone could think that this is something that belongs to the past, but just 8 years ago, in a survey conducted among several countries, it was asked if people would be ok to buy fruits and vegetables from vendors that are HIV-positive; 40% of the surveyed said no. Again, 40% of the survey participants said that children with HIV should stay in separate schools.  You might think that the stigma is not present anymore but actually, it is.   There are 3 movies related to HIV that the Professor suggests to watch: ● Philadelphia (1993). ● Dallas Buyers Club (2013). ● The Normal Heart (2014).  EPIDEMIOLOGY How many people with HIV are living in the world? Most recent data from the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAISD), suggest that they are 39 million. Focus also on the confidence interval (Fig. 4): 33.1 to 45.7 million, which is huge. This is because notification rates are really poor in many countries. It is more of an estimate: WHO takes notification rates from a few hospitals in each country, and then they model them in the population. There is no real number, \nFig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC 2  \nFig.2  \nFig.3  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 3 it is an estimation of people that might have HIV based on incidence and prevalence.  There is a significant portion of people who don’t know that are HIV positive. Hence the real notifications are much smaller. This again explains the big confidence interval.  Regarding incidence, people acquiring HIV are about 1.3 million. It went down, because, in the last 20 years, it was about 2 million.  Regarding mortality, 630.000 people die every year. It is 50% lower in respect to early 2000.  Mortality decreased considerably, while incidence did not so much. There are also 1.5 million children living with HIV. If they do not follow an antiviral therapy the onset of AIDS is about 5-10 y.o. dying around 10 y.o. \n As for prevalence, the countries with the highest values are South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, and Mozambique.   At the beginning of 2000, some countries had a prevalence of 33%. 1 person out of 3 was HIV-positive, it was really high. GDP in certain countries went down because of AIDS, and life expectancy dropped by about 10 years.  Incidence is very similar: some countries still have a significant incidence. These countries are in South Africa, South America, and a few in Asia (Myanmar, Papua New Guinea).  In many countries there are no data about incidence. For instance, in Italy we started collecting incidence data in 2005, before it was only recorded data about AIDS.  Looking at the curve (Fig. 5) the incidence has incredibly decreased in age groups. Probably just at the age of 50, the incidence is more stable with respect to the others. A reason could be that some people get HIV when they are older or they get it when are younger but are then diagnosed when are old.       \nFig.4  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 4  Globally speaking, certain areas are really doing good: in Eastern and Southern Africa new cases are decreasing (minus 57% of incidence), Western and Central Africa too. At the same time, the central part of the world is not doing good: Middle East and North Africa have an increase of 61% of the incidence; Eastern Europe and Central Asia have an increase of 49%. Latin America is quite stable. This tells something about prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and stigma.  WHO created this idea of “cascade of care”, the target for 2020 was 90-90-90: 90% of people with HIV must know their status, 90% of infected people must be in care, 90% of the treated people must have an undetectable viral load = virus is controlled. Today the target is 95-95-95, so super hard to get.  Every one of these boxes (Fig. 6), requires different approaches. To increase the number of people who live with HIV that know their status what must be done? Testing. How to increase testing? Campaign of sensitization; the professor doesn’t think that making the test mandatory would be an option; make the test free so that people are more prone to do it; expand the places and the time available to do the test. To increase the number of HIV-positive people on treatment is more complex. Sometimes people refuse to have the disease or don’t want to go to the hospital. Some patients, since they had symptoms for many years, don’t see it necessary to start the treatment. Keeping infected people strictly adherent to the treatment and so having an undetectable viral load, depends on the drugs that are used. Nowadays is one pill once a day, so not that hard, but they have to take it for their whole life. For this reason, adherence is very low.  \nFig.5  \nFig.6  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 5   Targets for incidence and mortality are represented in the graph (Fig. 7). In one year (2025) we should reach the targets designated. Since in 2022 we were here (Fig. 7), we are probably not reaching the target in time.  \n This is how different parts of the world are coping with the 90-90-90 target (Fig. 8): Africa is doing well in terms of how many people are getting tested, how many people are on treatment and how many have suppressed viral load. European regions, Eastern Mediterranean region, and South-East Asia are not doing good. Every country has a different story: in Mongolia, only 15% of people know their HIV status. \nFig.7  \nFig.8  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 6   Starting from 20 years ago, now it has reached a value of 30 million people on treatment. How much does it cost 1 month of treatment for a single patient in Italy? 700-1000 euro. So in 1 year it’s around 10.000, that multiplied by 40 (years of life expectancy) gives 400.000 for one patient. This is why in early 2000 only people living in high-resource countries were on treatment. What happens here (I think the professor refers to the gap between the 2010s column and the 2015 column in Fig. 9)? It was politics: From that moment the drug could be produced in India and Uganda decreasing the cost of 1 year of treatment to 15 dollars.  Hence today there is good coverage of 30 million out of 40 million HIV-positive. The costs are not only related to the drug: also the doctors, the nurses, the health-officers, people bringing drugs to small villages, and HIV tests have a cost. The cost is not covered by the countries but by PEPFAR, WHO, and other organizations. \nFig.9  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 7   To reduce the incidence of HIV, is necessary to target key populations. WHO identifies 12 key populations (Fig. 10) in which there is either a high prevalence of HIV or a low coverage of 90-90-90 target. Some of them are young women in certain scenario, prisoners, migrants, sex workers, injecting-drug users etc.  \n This graph (Fig. 11) is from a few years ago, but important: the dots are the prevalence of HIV in the female population (Zimbabwe 12%; Rwanda 5%; South Sudan 2%) while the bars are the prevalence in sex workers. \nFig.10  \nFig.11  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 8 Sex workers are at high risk for HIV, so testing and treating them reduces the complications for them but also reduces the transmission of HIV because they are not contagious anymore. Again, in the lower part, the dots are the prevalence in male populations, while the bars are the prevalence in MSM (which is several times higher). It is necessary to work on key populations.  \n  South and East Africa have (Fig. 12) a prevalence of 6% in the adult population, while for transgender women it’s at 28%; for sex workers at 33%.   One problem is criminalization: what does it happen if in a country being gay is actually illegal? Homosexual people cannot declare themselves about it. Also being a transgender woman in some countries is a risk of imprisonment. So in these countries, there are no data about how many people are homosexual or transgender. How can HIV be prevented in these categories at risk if it is not known where, who and how many they are? Criminalization reduces the possibility of focusing on these categories.  Even possessing (not selling) drugs is a risk of imprisonment in some countries. So is not possible to reduce the risk also in this category of people.  \nFig.12  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 9   The atlas of the UNAIDS (Fig. 13) gives some data about the prevalence in several countries according to sex workers (brown area means a prevalence of more than 10%), MSM, people who inject drugs (prevalence of HIV in Eastern Europe is super high), transgender women (very few data around the world), prisoners (because of IV drug use and sex done among prisoners. Indeed Switzerland decided to screen prisoners giving them also syringes and condoms). Fig. 13 is the atlas relative to sex workers, the atlas relative to the other mentioned categories are present on the slides.  PrEP is necessary to cover these risk categories if the goal is to reduce the incidence of HIV. Oral PrEP is less effective in women because it needs to be absorbed and distributed to the genital area, while in males it stays in the GI tract reaching the anus and protecting it during anal sex. This is why women need a higher dosage of oral PrEP or to use a vaginal ring or a vaginal gel. One treatment being approved in the US and Europe (but not yet present because of the costs) is an injection to do every 2 months called Cabotegravir. It protects nicely, and in women acts even better than in men.  Risk compensation theory: a person has a high risk of HIV infection because they do unprotected sex, but if they do the PrEP they could do even more unprotected sex, increasing the risk of infection of Chlamydia, Syphilis, Gonorrhea etc. Hence, many people were worried that giving PrEP would cause an increase in all the other STDs.  Studies so far suggested that there is a very small increase in the risk of STDs, that however doesn’t compensate for the decrease in the risk of HIV. So if someone argues with you proposing the risk compensation theory, you may reply that studies suggest that the risk is so small that PrEP is still cost-effective.    \nFig.13  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 10 EUROPEAN PERCENTAGES \n  ITALIAN PERCENTAGES At the moment probably there are around 150 000 people infected with HIV, a very low percentage because it accounts for less than 0.3% of the population and is decreasing over the years. Fig.15 shows data about the incidence and risk factors in Piedmont and it can be noticed that all the risk categories are decreasing except the MSM.  WHEN IS THE HIV TEST PERFORMED? Only 6% of the risk categories perform the test thanks to the screening campaigns. In fig.16 there are the most common reasons why an HIV test is performed.  Unfortunately in Italy the late diagnosis is still prevalent (25-45% of the cases).                      \nfig.\n5 \nFig.14  \nFig.15  \nFig.16  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 11 THE AIM OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM WAS THE PROGRESSION FOR THE 2021 TOWARD THE 90-90-90 CONCEPT - 90% of people living with HIV who are aware of their status - 90% of HIV patients on treatment - 90% of HIV patients virally suppressed  In fig.17 the real data of 2022 are shown. \n GOAL FOR THE FUTURE In the graph of fig.18 the annual data about 2 trajectories are shown:  In blue is the number of people newly infected by HIV; In yellow is the number of people dying from HIV-related causes; In the right part of the graph are indicated the objective for the 2025 and 2030 (the professor comments that in his opinion it will not be reached).         \n       \nFig.17  \nFig.18  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 12 ORIGIN THEORY HIV is a retrovirus and it is part of the Lentivirus family. The structure of the virus is very similar to the one of SIV (Simian immunodeficiency virus). The theory is that the first case at the end of the 19th century was a hunter who entered into contact with macaques in Central Africa, and the spillover happened. Hence, probably SIV adapted to humans and started spreading in Central Africa. There is also an interesting story about King Leopold, who decided to build railways in the current Democratic Republic of Congo for the mines. This was the actual way through which HIV spread through DRC and the adjacent countries and after that all around the world. The first death, certified by the collection of blood sample, occurred at the end of the 50s in Congo.  There was a paper in Nature suggesting through phylogenetic analyses that the first case was probably in 1931. Hence, why HIV was stable from the ’30s to the ’80s and then spread so quickly? A possibility could be the treatment for syphilis that has facilitated the spreading. Other possibilities are commercial sex and iatrogenic distribution (in Egypt HSV had a iatrogenic spread through vaccination). It is interesting to note that in some hosts this virus replicates and produces a disease very similar to the one caused by HIV, in other hosts (e.g. Green African monkey, Sooty, Mangabey) it replicates but it does not produce any damaging effect. Immunologists are still working on these differences to understand the relation of the virus with the host’s immune response.  VIROLOGY HIV is a retrovirus (Retroviridae-Lentiviridae), so a virus which needs reverse transcription from RNA to DNA, and then DNA integrates with the one of the host cell for its own replication. Humans, theoretically, do not have retrotranscriptase, this is why we can block this enzyme with some drugs without side effects.  HIV is very heterogeneous: retrotranscriptase is an enzyme that makes a lot of mistakes. So, by retrotranscription, in many copies mutations occur. Hence, some copies of the virus are defective, but some copies acquire mutations that increase the number of variants of HIV in the world. There are many variants of HIV1 characterized by different surface proteins and genome. It is not so important from a replicative POV, but resistance represents a concern: every subtype has a pathway to resist in some way. There is a high heterogeneity in viral quasispecies due to the fact that many mistakes are made by RT, resulting in the transcription of defective parts with significant differences. 109 approximate virions produced every day and 105 errors performed by the RT. This means that there is a constant evolution of the virus over time. There is also a great global variability in HIV-1, which is divided into three groups: - M (major) There are several subtypes within the M group: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, recombinant (CRF) and mixed (A_E). The presence of a recombinant and a mixed form suggests a complex evolution of the virus in the human host. - O (outlayer): located in West-Central Africa and is not usually seen outside of that area. - N (non-M, non-O).  How is it composed? Outside there is an envelope, going more internally there is the matrix, the capsid (core), and inside of the latter the 2 RNAs. The virion is composed of: - Matrix, internal capsule, and nucleocapsid made of proteins; 20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 13 - Enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (which allows the virus to integrate its DNA into cellular DNA) and protease (the DNA gets translated into large peptide sequences which are into single proteins by viral protease); - Membrane proteins of cellular or viral origin (gp120 and gp41); - Viral RNA: 9.7 Kb.  HIV-2 It is very similar to HIV1 in terms of genome sequences but very different in terms of transmission and progression to AIDS:  - Slower progression of the infection - Less contagious - Mostly observed in West Africa and Portugal (because some people that were born in West Africa moved to Portugal). Usually, tests include both HIV-1 and HIV-2. However, HIV-2 RNA is less standardized, so the monitoring of HIV-2 infection is more complicated but the prevalence is lower.  PATHOGENESIS Fusion and cell entry: The first phase of the process is the recognition from HIV of CD4+ T lymphocytes (T-helper) receptors (but this is also present in some other cells) by gp120, a viral glycoprotein which binds with CD4. T-helper are very important in the regulation of immune response.  This binding is very unstable and needs to be stabilized by co-receptors which are other proteins found in the human cell (host cell). These co-receptors are called CCR5 (mainly, is more important) or CXCR4. When the binding is stable the virus takes out a fusion protein called gp41: a sort of channel forms between the two membranes and so the virus can get into the cytoplasm of the target cell. \nWhy CCR5 is important? A study from the ‘90s showed that many sex workers from Nigeria exposed to HIV didn’t get infected because they lacked the gene for CCR5. Hence by not having CCR5 they were resistant to HIV infection. It came out that 1% of the European population is actually resistant to HIV because they do not have CC5R5 on their T-cells. This deletion is called delta32 mutation and it causes a lack of the CCR5’s external part. The mutation can be present in 2 forms: - patients having the mutation in one of the two alleles coding for CCR5 usually have a slow progression to AIDS. - patients having the deletion on both copies of the CCR5 gene are virtually resistant to HIV infection.  \nFig.19  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 14 Prevalence of Delta32 alleles is concentrated in Northern Europe and in Central-Northern Asia. The deletion seems to be apparently linked to some smallpox epidemics of several centuries ago, during which the lack of CCR5 was a genetic advantage providing better chances of survival. This finding is at the basis of one of the most important papers on the cure strategies for HIV: the Long-Term Control of HIV by CCR5 Delta32/Delta32 Stem-Cell Transplantation.  In 2009 the New England Journal of Medicine reported the case of Timothy Brown, an American HIV+ patient who lived in Germany. He developed acute myeloid leukemia which relapsed after both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, therefore, he underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The HLA matched donor was homozygous for CCR5/delta32. After 10 years of follow-up, the patient reached 100% chimerism: all his cells derived from the bone marrow of the donor were chimeric and lacking CCR5. He still had the HIV virus (a small amount of HIV RNA was found) but there had been no replication within the new cells. This meant that if the HIV reservoir is very, very low the immune system might be able to control it. This is the first case of a patient who was actually treated for HIV with a functional cure. Of course, it is impossible to perform a bone marrow transplant for 36 million people living with HIV but this is a potential way of controlling the infection: reducing the number of cells which can be infected by the virus. Furthermore, allogeneic stem cell transplantation has a mortality rate of >20%, hence it cannot be performed in all patients. Anyhow, it probably represents a “road” to some kind of strategy for a functional cure for HIV. If we understand how to delete CCR5 through gene therapy, or T cell transfer, people could be cured.   Life cycle: The life cycle of the virus is composed of many steps which approximately last 8-16 hours and some of them (the 5 in bold in the list below) can be targeted by drugs to inhibit HIV replication. Usually, the inhibition of at least two different mechanisms is combined to obtain better results: 1. Fusion: inhibition of the interaction between CD4 and gp120. 2. Reverse transcription: inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. 3. DNA translocation: DNA gets into the nucleus. 4. Integration: most important class of drugs, inhibition of integration of DNAv into human cells’ DNA. Because once it gets integrated, it cannot be eradicated. 5. Transcription. 6. Virion formation: targets the viral proteases which is an enzyme that humans do not posses. 7. Assemblement 8. Maturation and buddying. Today there are 26 drugs that can be used to deal with the 5 steps mentioned.  TRANSMISSION Humans are the only reservoir of HIV. Other animals, for instance cats, might have immunodeficiency viruses but they are not transmitted to humans and the same applies to SIV. HIV+ positive (not under treatment) can pass the infection to HIV- subjects if an adequate amount of virus is transmitted through an adequate route of transmission. HIV can be found in several biological liquids but can only be transmitted by: - Blood - Sperm - Breast milk - Cervical secretions They are considered epidemiologically responsible for the transmission. This is because of the greater amount 20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 15 of virus they contain (which is highest in blood and slightly lower in sperm, cervical secretions and milk). What about saliva? No, because even if the virus is in it, the viral load is very low. This is because it is rich in IgG and lysozymes that do not allow the virus to replicate. The virus is also in urine, but again is not contagious.   Three transmission routes are identified: ● Sexual: The risk of transmission for a single sexual intercourse is very low but the risk increases if it is multiplied by the number of multiple intercourses and by the number of different partners. It can also be noticed that the risk of transmission differs in case of the different infective partner: o WSM (vaginal transmission with female HIV+ and male HIV-): around 0.1%. Is not really high. How can it be so that there are 40 million people with HIV? It is basic epidemiology: it must be multiplied by the number of sexual acts, by the number of partners, by the risk percentage. Consider also that this risk is enhanced by STDs (2-6 times higher risk if someone has an STD). o MSW (vaginal transmission with male HIV + and female HIV-): around 0.2%, slightly higher than in the case of infected women. This is because semen stays in the vagina and also because in the vaginal wall there could be microlesions that allow entrance of HIV. o MSM (anal transmission): around 1%, 10 times higher compared to heterosexual transmission. This is because of the anal sex: anal mucosa is much more fragile and prone to rupture compared to the vaginal one and in blood there is the highest viral load.  Q: What about anal sex in which the receiving partner is positive and the giving partner is negative? A: It seems to be similar, always around 1%, because anal secretion allows blood to get out into the mucosa. Hence the risk for the giving partner is balanced, just as the HIV-positive semen of a giving partner can infect the receiving partner because of the microlesion in the anal canal. However receiving has a slightly higher risk than giving.  ● Parenteral: o Needle exchange among IDUs: risk around 1%. o Blood transfusions and hemoderivatives: risk around 95%. ● Vertical (i.e. from mothers to newborns. 24-40% of risk of transmission): o Transplacental (low). o During breastfeeding (medium).  o During delivery (high, 70% of risk). Q: I heard that breast could be contagious because by biting it there could be bleeding more than because of breastfeeding. Is it true? A: It is wrong, HIV is contained in breastmilk, so breastfeeding is a route of transmission.  HIV is contained in high amounts in breastmilk. \nFig.20  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 16 What should be done? We want all women to be tested for HIV and treated before pregnancy. However, in many countries, women are not often screened, and just go to the hospital for delivery. The second measure which can be taken is to do a Cesarean section which is faster and cleaner than vaginal delivery but again in many countries there are not enough surgeons. Finally, prophylaxis is necessary, together with artificial breastfeeding, which however needs clean drinking water which is not accessible in many places in the world. If prophylaxis (testing and treating pregnant women) is combined with cesarean section and followed by artificial breastfeeding, the risk of transmission can get lower than 1%. This is the strategy that has been adopted by most of the developed Countries. There are however many problems related to this strategy: ▪ In certain countries there is a surgeon every 10.000 (I think he refers to deliveries), so is impossible to do C-sections in all of them. ▪ Water is necessary to dilute the powder for artificial breastfeeding. If the water source is not clean, the newborn will die of diarrhea. A study in Botswana in the ‘90s  suggested that more children die because of diarrhea than HIV. If a mother is in treatment, breastfeeding is suggested until 6 months of age, then there is the switch to food. However, it  is important to not mix breastfeeding and food, because there could be an inflammation of the gut, increasing the risk for HIV. In certain countries, women breastfeed until the age of 3, for 2 reasons: absence of food and the fact that breastfeeding stimulates prolactin, which decreases fertility. Hence in some countries it’s difficult to convince a woman that she should not breastfeed. In certain countries (Nigeria, Angola, Chad, and Ghana) there is still a rate of transmission (through breastfeeding) above 15%. In Angola specifically, many women do not go to the hospital, anti-natal care is basically absent, delivery is done even at home. A possibility could be going to do the tests at home.  PATHOGENESIS Very few viruses directly attack the immune system (EBV is one of those, attacking B lymphocytes leading to lymphoma). HIV integrates into the cell genome, causing first a chronic infection before becoming deadly, which is a crucial mechanism for the spread of infection. In fact, up to 10 years can pass from the HIV infection to the development of AIDS. During that time, positive patients usually feel pretty well and thus might be unaware of their situation and infect others.  This is a favourable factor for the spreading of the virus, different from Ebola which with its high mortality causes epidemics in small villages and cannot diffuse more since everyone dies. The infection is not only directed to T lymphocytes, because the late-stage pathology can affect any type of cells: macrophages, microglia (leading to problems in the brain), Kupffer cells (in the liver), in the skin, myocardial cells (leading to myocardial infarction), cervix cells (leading to cervical carcinoma), etc… except for neurons, not known why. It’s very important to notice that on one side affected people are subjected to severe immunosuppression, but they also have a Th2 shift which leads to a lot of allergies and immune disorders. This unbalanced response is an attempt by T lymphocytes to attack pathogens. Hence at the same time, there is immune activation and immune deficiency. It hanges quite frequently in the host, therefore, it is hard for the immune system to kill it and it is also difficult 20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 17 to develop a vaccine. Why is HIV eradication not possible at the moment? Free virions can survive just a matter of minutes/hours while resting CD4+ with integrated provirus might survive years. They can stay in lymph nodes even for 15-17 years, and when they proliferate, they do so with the HIV DNA starting a new cycle of HIV replication. This, together with the facts that in several organs (including brain, lymph nodes and gut) the antiviral drugs concentration that can be reached through treatment is not enough, is evidence of the fact that HIV cannot be eradicated.  Immunodeficiency: (slide skipped by the professor) HIV causes a reduction of T lymphocytes, specifically of CD4+ T lymphocytes which are the cells coordinated in response to external pathogens. - Direct damage to the cells (cytopathic effect). - Syncytium formation. - Increased susceptibility to apoptosis (infected cells die earlier than other cells). - Phagocytosis-lysis from the immune system (there is an auto-destruction of CD8- NK and a further reduction of CD4+ T cells). Hence, even if the final deficit is in CD4+ T lymphocytes, there is an additional reduction of function in several other cells. - Shift to Th2 response, meaning that there is an increased risk of allergies and adverse reaction to drugs.   NATURAL COURSE The natural course of HIV consists in (Fig. 21):  1. Primary (acute) infection: from the exposure it occurs in 1-3 weeks. It can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, but the vast majority are asymptomatic. Hence they are not aware of it 2. serological conversion: after 1 month there is the development of antibodies against HIV, which is the phase when HIV tests turn out positive. 3. After seroconversion, the infection runs several years (7-10 years) as asymptomatic (just HIV-test can detect it), with just some lymphadenitis. 4. In the pre-symptomatic phase, the patient develops minor opportunistic infections until the development of major opportunistic infections (symptomatic phase) that are diagnostic for AIDS.          BIOMARKERS \nFig.21  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 18 Look at this graph (Fig. 22):  ● number of CD4+ T lymphocytes (in green): usually they are around a 1000 ● number of viral load, the number of copies of HIV per mL of blood. (in blue) Once the virus enters in contact with the mucosa, it takes 48 hours to enter the circulatory system (blood). This is why to do post-exposure prophylaxis there is a window of 48 (maximum 72 h) hours. The virus starts to replicate in millions of copies while CD4+ starts decreasing a little bit and then goes back to normality (very first brief slop on the left), this is the asymptomatic phase: there is an equilibrium between the immune system and the virus. When the immune system is not able to renovate all the cells (B cells, T cells, MK cells) HIV starts to replicate again. Hence the number of CD4+ cells decreases and the patient becomes in immunodeficiency status.  2 values that must be remembered are: - CD4+ below 500: clinical manifestations start appearing. - CD4+ below 200: onset of AIDS.  The viral load increases during infection but actually CD8+ cells are able to control the spread of infection for the whole latent phase but once CD4 cells start to decrease, the viral load increases exponentially. Thus, the most infectious people are either those in the acute phase or patients in the late stages.  PRIMARY INFECTION Why the focus on HIV primary infection?  ● Because is necessary to recognize people with HIV primary infection.  ● They are really contagious and they do not know to have it, so they have sex. Hence if primary infections are recognized, the HIV transmission is reduced.  ● If the patient is treated during acute infection, it’s possible to reduce the number of tissue in which HIV could be. HIV gets quickly in blood and then requires a few days to get into brain, lymph nodes, gut, bone marrow etc. By treating patients at this stage, the number of cells infected by HIV is reduced. Hence these people will have a very healthy life expectancy Most primary infections are asymptomatic, but patients can present with mononucleosis-like symptoms:  - Fever: Mild to high-grade fever, usually above 100.4°F (38°C). - Rush. - Swollen lymph nodes: Enlarged and tender lymph nodes, especially in the neck and armpits. - Headache: Mild to severe headaches, often described as a throbbing or pulsating sensation. Since they are very specific symptoms, no one would think about HIV. If a sexually active patient presents mononucleosis-like symptoms it should be asked tests for EBV, CMV, toxo, and HIV. Other symptoms that my present during primary infection not mentioned this year: - Loss of appetite: Reduced desire to eat or a decreased interest in food. \nFig.22  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 19 - Swollen spleen and liver: In some cases, the spleen and liver may become enlarged, leading to upper abdominal pain or tenderness. - Muscle aches and joint pain: Generalized muscle and joint discomfort, which may be more prominent during physical activity. - Sore throat: A severe and painful throat, often accompanied by redness and swelling. - Night sweats: Excessive sweating during sleep, which may disrupt sleep patterns. - Nausea or digestive issues: Mild stomach discomfort, nausea, or changes in bowel habits. - Fatigue: Persistent tiredness or lack of energy that may not improve with rest.  Minor disorders: 1. Oral Candidiasis (Thrush): A fungal infection characterized by white patches in the mouth and throat. 2. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections: Recurrent or severe infections caused by the herpes virus, resulting in oral or genital ulcers. 3. Bacterial Pneumonia: Infections of the lungs caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. 4. Tuberculosis (TB): An infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria that primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other organs. 5. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection: A viral infection that can affect various organs, including the eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. 6. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) Infection: A bacterial infection that can affect multiple organs, particularly the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. 7. Toxoplasmosis: An infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which can affect the brain and other organs. 8. Bacterial Infections: Increased susceptibility to various bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, skin infections, and bloodstream infections. 9. Fungal Infections: Increased risk of opportunistic fungal infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and cryptococcal meningitis.  DIAGNOSIS PHI is diagnosed using IV generation serological test (immune assay); that is because the IV generation also includes a viral antigen (i.e. it does not only detect the production of IgG against HIV but also the presence of p24 antigen). This is of enormous importance with HIV because the test turns out positive even in the first few days after the infection and is therefore useful to catch the infection in the very first phase.  Q: Is this test available everywhere? A: Yes.  Q: Is there any chance of false positive and false positive? A: IV generation tests have very high sensitivity and specificity (above 99%). So the probability of having a false positive or false negative is below 0.01%  Diagnosis needs to be confirmed by HIV RNA (which is the most rapid marker of HIV infection). Western blot was used in the past as a confirmatory test, but nowadays it is only useful for staging PHI. There is also an avidity test, but it is not really widespread. In some countries where there is no PCR, they do 3 different tests.   20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 20 This (Fig. 23) was a study done in Thailand and East Africa in collaboration with Yale University and Bangkok. It was conducted in bars, clubs and nasty places where they enrolled people with an age between 18 and 50 with these features:  ● They exchange moneys for sex. ● They had unprotected sex with somebody HIV-positive. ● They did unprotected sex with 3 more partners in the previous months. ● They had an a STD. These people came twice a week for a small finger blood collection, just a drop, and they did the HIV RNA test. If one of these drop was positive, they all had to come back to test their peripheral blood. They tested 4000 people and they were able to capture 261 acute infection within a year. They were able to understand that the peak of HIV is around 10 days, so they knew when they got HIV. Also symptoms were around 10 days. The unlucky part is that symptoms are fever, headache, and malaise, so it’s really difficult to diagnose acute HIV. However, some of them had other symptoms such as lymphadenitis and encephalitis.  ASYMPTOMATIC PHASE \n  Represents the equilibrium between viral replication and immune system. The plasma viral load is correlated with the rapidity of clinical progression (the higher the viral load the quicker the progression). Therefore, in the past, it was common to treat patients in relation to their viral load; nowadays instead, every HIV+ patient undergoes the same treatment and viral load is used only to measure the response to treatment.  As for the progression, it typically takes a few years to get to the AIDS phase. The higher the viral load, the quicker the evolution: people with 1 million HIV copies per mL go much faster to AIDS compared to those with a thousand.  The average progression to AIDS is 7 to 10 years, however, there are some peculiar categories: - Rapid progressors, in which AIDS is observed within 2-3 years; \nFig.23  \nFig.24  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 21 - Elite controllers are patients (approx. 1% of HIV patients) that are able to control HIV without treatment. Why? Is it because of the virus or the immune system? Mostly it’s the immune system. There are certain HLA subtypes that are associated with control, which contributes to keep the virus integrated in the genome without having its transcription. The virus is silent. These patients could result positive with an HIV test, but negative with PCR. In this case is not a false positive but an elite controller. If Western blot is done, antibodies against several bands of HIV would appear.  AIDS RELATED COMPLEX (ARC) They can happen in all kinds of immunodepression. They are early signs of immunodepression. Hence if these signs are present even in someone who doesn’t have HIV, there could be something wrong with their immune system. ● Persistent generalized lymphadenitis (PGL) ● Fever > 1 month ● Chronic diarrhea > 1 month ● Weight loss > 10% body weight ● Thrombocytopenia: there are several cases of people followed by hematologists because none linked thrombocytopenia to HIV in the past. They used to look just for antibodies anti-platelets, corticosteroids etc. ● Minor opportunistic infections: o Oral candidiasis (Fig. 25): several categories of patients may develop oral candidiasis (they can be young, old, diabetics, under steroid therapy, immunosuppressed). Suspicion of HIV should arise if someone not at risk develops persistent oral candidiasis. o Hairy leukoplakia (Fig. 26): is a manifestation in the tongue commonly related to EBV reactivation, anyhow it provides information about the status of the patient’s immune system. o Herpes Zoster (Fig. 27): one of the most important manifestations is multi-metameric or relapsing Herpes Zoster (called Fuoco di Sant’Antonio) because it highlights a deficit in the immune system. When there is an activation of the zoster is dermal: is just a skin part related to one nerve. Herpes Zoster should never cross the median line because dermatomes stop at the median line. Therefore, if a Herpes Zoster affects one part of the body and crosses the median line reaching the other part of the body it is evidence of something affecting the immune system, hence HIV should be suspected. It should be one-sided, so if the lesion is on the right side, it \nFig.25  \nFig.26  \nFig.27  20.03.2024                                                                                                                                                CALCAGNO L.05   \nLuca Polizzi, Eleonora Deinite                                                                                                                              PAGE 22 shouldn’t be also on the left. Even if it is on one side but on different dermatomes, there is an immune system problem. It is characterized by vesicles, pustules, and crusts.  o Molluscum contagiosum (Fig. 28): is an infection caused by poxvirus usually observed in children (small epidemics in kindergarten or primary school). Soft vesicles are umbilicated in the lid. It could be self-infectious. It can also be seen in HIV positive patients especially on face and arms. o Seborrheic dermatitis: even healthy people have it. It is caused by the overgrowth of a fungus. In people with HIV is more widespread, is recurrent and doesn’t respond to treatment. Because the immune control in the skin fungus is zero. There is erythema around the nose and the scalp, and there is a patchy greasy formation over it. o Condyloma: They might be present in the anus being asymptomatic. o Tuberculosis: it is much more common in HIV patients, who also have a high probability of reactivation (almost 100%, and often associated with extrapulmonary expressions of the disease). The problem is that immunosuppressed patients need to have TB eradicated to the last bacteria, as they lack any immune response to remove even the smallest traces of mycobacterium. Moreover, in severe cases of AIDS, granulomas are not formed, leading to complete lung destruction and pleural effusion, but TB is not visible on the X-Ray because of the lack of granulomas.  The clinical presentation of TB in patients living with HIV (fig.20) is variable and it depends on CD4+ cell count: ▪ In high CD4+ cell count, the clinical presentation is very similar to that of HIV-negative patients (e.g. cavities) ▪ In low CD4+ cell count, there might be only mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleurisy, effusion or even a normal chest X-ray.

I know that you’ve studied TB in microbiology and heard something about it in the respiratory course but I want to explain to you something different such as for example TB in immunosuppressed patients or extrapulmonary complications. What I want you to know is first of all that diagnosis of TB is based on serology.   In this lesson we will talk about: 1. Epidemiology  2. Microbiology  3. Transmission  4. Pathogenesis 5. Clinical presentation (pulmonary and extrapulmonary)  6. IRIS  7. Diagnosis  8. Latent TB  9. Treatment 10.MDR and XDR TB  I want to go through a little comparison between TB and Pneumonia (fig.1). If you are a doctor in an ER, which patient do you think is the one with the most serious clinical presentation? CAP We usually imagine TB patients always with hemoptysis and severe clinical presentation immediately as acute onset, but this is not true.  If you think about CAP the patient will come with high grade fever, acute onset, possible dyspnea and lymphocytosis. While in TB low grade fever, subacute onset, weight loss, night sweat and WBC are usually normal. So the presentation is quite different and you might see hemoptysis in TB but in really advanced stages. Hemoptysis means blood in the sputum, and it is usually when there is a cavity and the cavity starts to involve blood vessels so bleeding is starting. Both patients can have thoracic pain and pleural effusion. They may have something common so there might be pain due to pleural involvement because in the lung we do not have neural processes.  Of course there are chest x-rays and CT-scans that appear very similar.                               fig.1 \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   2 This (fig.2) is called a tree in buddy. It looks like a tree that has fruits on the branches. It is caused by end bronchial dilation that is due to bacterial or fungal infection. This is very typical of bacterial pneumonia. Consolidation in one area of the lung can be appreciated (fig. 3)                                  fig.2             fig.3  While if you see a cavity like this it can be TB but also cancer. Or it can be a previous TB and now we have the granuloma. (fig. 4)          fig.4  EPIDEMIOLOGY Remember that we think one quarter of the human population can be infected by mycobacteria. So the estimate is that 1.6 billion people have mycobacteria in their lungs. Our task is to identify the people at risk of reactivation. So we will talk about latent and active infections and there is a very important difference. How many people have an active TB disease manifesting respiratory symptoms? It is around 10.6 million, so the numbers are really high. 10% are children. HIV, TB and malaria are the most important worldwide killers (fig.5)  with the highest rate of mortality (6 million people dying every year).By the way, it is difficult to say that you died because of TB so we rather say that you died with TB, we focus on people that die with an TB infection ongoing.  Men have higher incidence and worst prognosis while in most of the infectious diseases females have higher incidence and worst prognosis. Every year the incidence is falling by 2%. Of course there are 30 countries with very high endemic TB. Together they have 80% of all the cases. India, China, Indonesia, Nigeria and South Africa are the most important ones. (fig. 6)  \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   3            fig.5  TB is the number 13 cause of death. If you go to endemic countries, it is number two. With the maps you have an idea of the incidence. Countries with the darker colors, depicted in fig.6, are those with the higher incidence. Dark blue is more than 500 cases per 100.000.                   fig.6  In Europe the incidence is between 6 and 10. In Italy it is 6. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia it is 100 times higher. This data is for active TB for latent TB we do not have clear data, we just have the estimates. We will discuss HIV in depth, because it can accelerate lots of other infections and diseases. HIV is a strong factor for TB activation and TB accelerates HIV. Since you have both it is harder to treat, and the mortality is higher. Of course every HIV patient should be tested for TB. Just to give you an example, more than 50% of TB patients in South Africa have HIV. For this reason, it is very important to test for HIV. Q: Why is there a so strict correlation between HIV and TB, is this because of immunosuppression ?  A: It is. HIV can increase the TB risk of reactivation.   In 2020, due to COVID, there was a reduction in notification rates for TB and in specific areas this decrease was really steep, especially in notifications by hospitals. This means that in these countries they were not \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   4 able to notify TB patients. For example, Angola in 2020-2021 did not receive TB medication for months, without any medication at all. Half of TB cases now have resistance. As we can appreciate in fig.7 less notifications correlate with higher mortality. A paradox is that patients with HIV receive better care in certain countries than patients without HIV, thus focusing on HIV is important. As you can see here mortality related to HIV has decreased. Covid had an important impact on TB.                            fig.7  In Europe last year we had 33.000 cases and the countries with the highest numbers are in East Europe. The number in Europe has slightly decreased. In Italy, according to the latest data, we have a low incidence country with 5 cases per 100000 people. It has prevalence in two populations: young patients that are born abroad since migration is a risk factor, and then we have people that were born in Italy above the age of 65, because age is an important immune suppressor factor. In Piedmont we have 400 cases per year. People that were born abroad have an average age of 30, while those that borned in Italy have reactivation at the age of 65.  We can appreciate that there is a correlation with TB and the hours of sunlight (fig.8). In areas with lower sunlight, we have higher incidence of TB. That is because of the strong correlation of vitamin D and TB. Vitamin D is one of the hormones that controls T Cells response. So the lowest vitamin D, the higher the risk for tuberculosis. Overall all those factors that are able to reduce the immune system function can induce TB reactivation passing from a latent and silent infection to the clinical onset of symptoms.  fig.8  \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   5 MICROBIOLOGY I do not want to go back to what you studied in microbiology. I just want to remind you of some things. First, mycobacterium tuberculosis is a complex of mycobacteria: M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti and others.  M. bovis is the only exception because the spread is not from person to person but from contact with cows, so direct contact or ingesting dairy products that derive from cows infected with M. bovis.             fig.9 For these reasons, we commonly have intestinal TB due to the ingestion of milk. So less respiratory much more intestinal. M. bovis causes 3% of TB overall, while in India it is 15%.  Rod shaped bacillum, not mobile, not sporogenous and very small (fig.9). They are strict aerobes and can survive where there is a high concentration of O2. They can survive and replicate both extracellularly and intracellularly, in fact they are able to infect macrophages and survive inside of them. Normally macrophages can survive for years so that’s why M.tuberculosis infection can persist for so long. I also want to remind you that the cell wall of mycobacteria is really complex. It is made of several waxy layers composed of mycolic acid and this guarantees resistance against the immune system. This is why the replication cycle is so long. If you do a culture you have to wait 30-70 days, so we usually perform a test in order to detect LAM (lipoarabinomannan). This is enough concerning microbiology, I don’t want to go into details.   TRANSMISSION  The transmission is airborne, but you have to remember three different ways of airborne transmission (depending on the weight of the particles). Fig.10 1. Big droplets that can travel up to 1 meter. (e.g, If I have meningitis from neisseria I will transmit it to people one meter away from me). They are very big particles.  2. Small droplets can travel more, up to 3 meters. (e.g. TB) 3. Infectious droplets that can be viruses (e.g influenza). It can affect anyone in the room. The transmission of TB depends also on the environment. For example, twenty people living together in a small room without windows, fresh air and sunlight, those are the cases where the transmission is higher. People migrating to other countries in the first years live in conditions like these and this causes reactivation of TB.  fig.10   \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   6 PATHOGENESIS If one of you has tuberculosis, 90% of droplet nuclei are withheld and expelled by the ciliary system; the smallest particles (<2 μm) can reach distal alveolar spaces which are full of alveolar macrophages. The first step is basically phagocytosis, where mycobacteria are eaten by macrophages. Macrophages try to use lysosome and reactive oxygen species in order to get rid of those bacteria entered in the airways. When macrophages are not able to get rid of the mycobacteria, they start producing a lot of chemokines that attract other cells and specifically other macrophages. At the end of this process of recruitment we observe the formation of the granuloma. In the middle of TB granuloma, we have caseous necrosis because macrophages, inflammatory cells and bacteria themselves remain without oxygen. This is specific for TB because we also have granuloma in other diseases (specifically in chronic conditions) but not caseous necrosis as: NTM, Brucella, Sarcoidosis, fungal infections and lymphomas (fig.11) \nfig.11  Then we have an intermediate stratum of macrophages and monocytes and then the external stratum that is made of epithelioid and giant nucleated cells. One thing that I want you to remember is that this structure is not stable. You constantly renovate the wall with the aim to block whatever is inside. This process is very sensitive to immune depression. Even if years after I acquire HIV or if I do extensive use of corticosteroid I am not able to replicate the wall and mycobacteria slowly replicate and I will have secondary TB. The immune system is required to replace the cells in the “protective wall”. Before giving immune suppressor drugs, I have to test the patient for HIV, TB and syphilis. If I have a TB patient, I do not initiate the treatment otherwise the risk of reactivation is very high.   In the majority of people infected with mycobacteria the response of the macrophages is very effective and they form the granuloma which protects them. However, 5-10% of the people have a weak macrophage response. Who are those? Immunosuppressed people and kids below the age of 5. They receive tuberculosis and the symptoms start within the next few days. The fact is that if I am not able to control TB in my lungs, mycobacteria will spread all over the body (primary TB). What is important to underlie about primary TB is the high amount of extrapulmonary manifestations (e.g. TB meningitis that has a very high mortality) BCG vaccine is an attenuated mycobacterium. It is used for many years as a vaccination for TB. The problem with the vaccine is that it does not prevent secondary tuberculosis. It only prevents primary tuberculosis. This vaccination is used nowadays only in children in order to prevent TB meningitis. As you get the granuloma, the vaccine is not useful anymore. \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   7 The other 90-95% of the population have a good and efficient response with the formation of the granulomas. This is the reason why 95% of the people have latent tuberculosis without  any type of symptoms so basically the infection remains but is controlled and confined. The risk of reactivation is 5-10% (secondary TB). Going back to numbers if we have 1.5 billion people with tuberculosis we will have 150 million reactivations. In HIV patients without treatment the risk of reactivation increases 10% every year. In ten years all of them will have TB.  CLINICAL PRESENTATION As we said there is the classical TB presentation: ● Insidious onset and chronic course ● Chest symptoms: cough (usually productive), hemoptysis (late) and chest pain (usually pleuritic) ● Nonspecific constitutional symptoms (more common in children and HIV) ● Extrapulmonary symptoms (if involved) But we also have some not specific ones. Often we see patients with: ● Fever in 65-80% of cases  ● Chills/night sweats  ● Fatigue/malaise ● Anorexia/weight loss However, 10-20% of TB cases have no symptoms at the moment of diagnosis. Probably you should understand that it is chronic, subacute and also you have to consider if someone was born in a country with high incidence of TB. This is why the diagnosis of people born in Italy is much more delayed compared to those born abroad.   The appearance of TB in x rays can be different as we mentioned in the beginning of the lecture. It can appear as a buddy tree or as consolidation. It can be a cavity as you can see in fig.12, or multiple as in fig.13. Whenever you see pulmonary cavitation, you must think about NTM, fungi, cancer or pulmonary vasculitis but you should never exclude tuberculosis too. But overall do not think about TB only as people with cavities and hemoptysis because the spectrum is really wide. This is how TB is represented in lungs but what about TB outside the respiratory system?  \n            fig.12                                                                            fig.13   \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   8 Now we move to extrapulmonary disease. ● Miliary or disseminated TB is like sepsis but with TB. It’s rare but is dangerous. We are not able to control TB and it spreads everywhere lungs, blood and lymph nodes. This condition is characterized by a lot of small nodules spread everywhere (reticulonodular pattern). This is considered an emergency condition because as well as for sepsis, is an acute and rapidly evolving condition with fever and dyspnea.  So what you see again here is the reticular aspects with hundreds of thousands very small nodular lesions in the interstitium. These all are granulomas that have been spread everywhere. The granuloma are not only in the lungs they are also in the larynx and in the mouth that’s why people presenting with miliary tuberculosis are very contagious.                               fig.14  We do not need to remember all the TB diseases but to remember that it can occur everywhere. So in the differential diagnosis of whatever, you need to think about TB.   ● TB lymphadenitis. Mainly affects children and usually is infraclavicular, cervical or submandibular. TB from lungs spread into mediastinal lymph nodes. Usually is monolateral, if you have bilateral means that is something systemic (remember that when you observe fever and bilateral cervical lymph nodes swelling you must think about something viral). The lymph nodes are soft, non-painful and they are cold. Remember that this is an important characteristic: when you  observe cold lymph nodes you must think about TB. All abscess and bacterial lymphadenoma are all warm (sign  of inflammation: tumor, rubor, calor, dolor). If you have a mouth abscess or a dental one the lymph nodes in the neck are swollen, painful and hot. So every time that you see TB lymphadenitis the lymph nodes are cold. One of our patients was a young man from Somalia and he got spondylitis, an infection in the spine and an abscess in his back. There was a huge lymph node and it was cold. For diagnosis you can perform some biopsies through needles inserted in the abscess, cultivation and detection of TB. By the way lymphadenitis is not so dangerous and is considered a benign form, mortality in this case is really low.  fig.15 ● TB serositis (pericarditis, peritonitis or pleuritis). Is uncommon but all serosa can be affected. Of course among the three, pleuritis is the most common because the lungs are the primary site of \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   9 infection. Pericarditis is rare and has a lot of complications as for peritonitis. Remember that when you see a patient with unexplained serositis, always think about TB. For diagnosis you can cultivate serosal fluid in order to detect TB. ● Laryngeal TB is highly contagious (fig.16) ● Skin TB. This one is a patient from South America that presents with these lesions similar to eczema but our suspicion of TB is very high so we did a biopsy of one of the lesions. (fig.18) fig.16 \nfig.17                                                                          fig.18  ● CNS TB. As we said before this is the condition that  presents the highest mortality rate. TB meningitis is a very atypical form. It presents a slow onset with weight loss and cranial nerves paralysis. Hydrocephalus is very common due to altered CSF circulation). CSF is clear with lymphocytes, elevated proteins and very low glucose content. TB can also generate tuberculomas. The patient will present with CNS symptoms and we do a CT scan or an MRI. ● You can also have TB in the spine. It is usually in the thoracic spine. This is the difference between TB and acute bacterial spondylitis-Pott’s disease-(more common in the lumbar part). TB is usually in the thoracic part because it is in contact with the lungs. It is a very slow process.  ● We can also have TB in genital and urinary tract.   IRIS IRIS is an acronym that stands for Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Is something that we discovered when people with HIV were treated with antivirals and the immune system increased (T cells) and after that patients felt worse. It is defined as \"a paradoxical inflammatory reaction against a foreign antigen (alive or dead) in patients who have started antiretroviral therapy and who have undergone a reconstitution of their immune responses against this antigen”.  IRIS Pathogenesis  ● Increased lymphoproliferative response to mycobacterium antigens in vitro  ● Restoration of cutaneous response to Tuberculin  \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   10 ● Increased [Il-6], activation markers (CD38) ● Associated with TNFA-308*1, IL6-174*G  I had a patient present with very low CD4 cell count. Sputum was TB negative. We treated the immunosuppression. After two months the patient presented with fever and weight loss. Basically TB was there but the immune system was so weak that it was not able to recognize it. Just right after iatrogenic stimulation, an inflammatory reaction occurred. The immune system was cured and was strong enough to recognize TB.              fig.19 IRIS  Treatment   «Unmasking IRIS»  ● Absent before starting antiretroviral therapy  ● Need diagnosis and treatment of the opportunistic infection  «Worsening» IRIS  ● Management of the infection including treatment and source control ● NSAIDs if mild  ● Corticosteroids (Prednisone 1 mg/kg)  ● Antiretroviral therapy interruption in case of life-threatening or ● serious disorders (CNS or eye involvement)  DIAGNOSIS Remember that latent and active TB are two different things. We need some epidemiological features and some clinical features. How do we diagnose active tuberculosis ? Sputum, serum or urine samples (in order to look for TB bacteria directly or some parts of them as LAM) and culture (14-15 days) represent the gold standard in microbiology. What we can do to save more time is stain to see TB bacteria directly through a microscope (Ziehl-Neelsen staining) and then culture is performed later for confirmation. Another option is PCR (everywhere in the world nowadays) that is very fast (6hr), the machine does everything. Remember that there is a very wide spectrum in TB from active, subclinical and latent. So it is really important to diagnose the infection in time in order to avoid spread among other individuals. When, instead, we want to diagnose latent tuberculosis we have two tests. (we performed those in migrants or immunosuppressed people in order to exclude a possible TB latent infection).    \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   11 One is the Mantoux test (fig.20). We just inject intradermally a protein from Mycobacterium TB and we see in three days how big the reaction is. We have to measure the papula. If the papula is above 1 cm it is positive. There are a lot of false positives due to the bcg vaccination (tuberculosis vaccine). The problem is that it is not so sensitive and we need the people to come back in 3 days and someone will forget. The cost is one euro per test. The other test is a group of tests called Interferon gamma release assays (IGA) and QuantiFERON (fig.21) is the most used one. I take blood from a patient and I put it in four tubes, each of them with different things.         fig.20                               fig.21  In one tube I got nothing, in one tube I put mitogen which increases the reactivity of T cells and then I have 2 tubes with MTB antigens. I measure how much interferon γ is produced in each tube. If I see higher production in the tubes with MTB antigens means that T cells have been previously sensitized to TB, so that's a latent TB. I also measure mitogen response because if the patient’s T cells are not reacting it means the immune system is not functioning properly. T cells react to TB antigens with very high sensitivity. Just one time the patient does not have to come back. It is expensive so we use it in immunocompromised patients or to confirm the Mantoux test. Remember that some NTM can lead to false positives even in QuantiFERON tests. fig.22 LATENT TB TREATMENT  Let’s say that one of you is tested positive. Would you receive treatment or not? The risk of activation is 5-10% so in 90% of people treatments are not necessary. The treatment is cheap but with a lot of side effects. This is the list that CDC suggests to treat: • People living with HIV (PLWH)  \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   12 • Recent contacts of a TB case if you are exposed to someone with TB they will give you a Mantoux test if it is negative it will be repeated in six months. If in six months it is positive it means that you recently got infected by TB and you will receive the treatment because in the first 2 years the granuloma is very unstable, so the risk of reactivation is higher during this time. By the way latent TB is not infectious at all.    • Persons with fibrotic changes on chest x-ray consistent with old TB  • Organ transplant recipients  • Persons who are immunosuppressed for other reasons (e.g., taking the equivalent of >15 mg/day of prednisone for 1 month or longer, taking TNF-α antagonists) • Persons from high-prevalence countries  • Injection drug users • Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, homeless shelters, hospitals, and other health care facilities) • Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel  • Children under 4 years of age, or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories  We give Isoniazid for 6 months and in pregnant women we also give vitamin B6. Or we give rifampin for 4 months. The treatment is shorter and with less drugs compared to the one of the active TB.  ACTIVE TB TREATMENT  Remember that during bacterial replication we observe an heterogeneous colony (fig.23), they are all different. Is not true to say that they are all the same copy of the first bacterium. So we observe in some of the newly formed bacteria some drug resistance. That’s why it is important to use different drugs simultaneously. Is important to eradicate all the different colonies that are forming all with different characteristics: rapidly growing, slowly growing or with sporadic replication (TB in macrophages replicate once every two weeks).         fig.23 Drugs have different effects on those populations. Isoniazid is more efficient on rapidly growing bacterias, Pyrazinamide on slowly growing and Rifampicin os sporadically growing. So for those replicating quickly, isoniazid is the best drug. For those replicating in caseous necrosis only Pyrazinamide works because it is activated by low ph. Rifampicin is the most important drug to eradicate MTB. After 2 weeks of treatment contagiousness is 5%.    We use four drugs: Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol, Isoniazid. We give all 4 together for 2 months and then we give Rifampicin and Isoniazid for 4 months. We give four drugs to avoid resistance and we have to consider that every population of mycobacteria is not homogenous. So if I combine 4 drugs the probability of resistance to all of them is very low. Another reason is that mycobacteria are not homogenous in terms of growth.                     fig.24 \n08.03.24                                                                                                                                                     CALCAGNO L.01   \nUmberto Geninatti, Samuele Scagliola   13 We have at the beginning a lot of mycobacteria replicating extracellularly, then we have some bacteria replicating in caseous necrosis and very few of them inside macrophages. I will just give an example of leprosy. We give one dose every six months because they replicate very slowly.  What about side effects? (fig.24). Rifampicin can cause the excretion of orange urine and all other body fluids. Three of them are hepatotoxic (no ethambutol) so we need to check liver enzymes to prevent severe hepatic failure. Ethambutol is also associated with color blindness and it is irreversible in some patients.  Remember that isoniazid must be given with Vit.B6 otherwise you will have peripheral neuropathy. In certain scenarios we have to go beyond 6 months as in TB meningitis or bone disease. Theoretically the efficacy of the 4 drugs is 95% but according to the data the real efficacy is around 85% because some patients will die, some patients will stop taking the drugs and some of them will have severe side effects. So the real efficacy is 85%. But in HIV patients the efficacy is 75%. It is hard to treat because the immune system is not functioning properly. In MDR-TB the efficacy is 50%.  MDR AND XDR TB The difficulty is in resistant tuberculosis. This is something that I ask in the exams. This is the definition of Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and Extensively Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR TB). MDR TB is resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin. We have 450.000 cases in the world so 3% of all the TB cases. While XDR TB is extremely resistant to fluoroquinolones and one group A drug (bedaquiline). XDR TB is 6% of the 3% (MDR TB). In Russia more than 50% of TB relapse are drug resistant. Also in Somalia, East Europe and South Asia. Estonia has the highest proportion of MDR cases in europe. (fig.26) Before the new guideline, the treatment for resistant strains was 5 to 6 drugs for 2 years with a lot of side effects (not well tolerated by patients). The new guideline consists of 3 to 4 drugs (bedaquiline, pretomanid,linezolid and moxifloxacin) for 6 months, some of them are also intravenous. It is effective, short and well tolerated.

The second reason is that in certain countries (USA included) the incidence of NTM pulmonary disease is higher than the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. In Italy we don’t have epidemiological data to compare the two diseases, but it’s probably the same. The definition of NTM is a negative one: NTM comprehend all the species other than: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. bovis, M. caprae, M. microti, M. leprae (etiological agent of leprosy), M. pinnipedii, M. canettii.   There are more than 150 species, of which 60 are considered pathological for humans. Most of them to be pathological require a very strong immune depression, this is why they are common in ospital. The severity of the pathogen can also be imagined by the velocity of growth. how quickly they grow tells us about how quickly they can create issues in the organisms.   CLASSIFICATION There are two kind of classification for NTM.  The first one classifies them into: ● Rapid growing mycobacteria: grow in less than 7 days. Further divided in: 1. pigmented; 2. non pigmented, which are very important, because M. abscessus, M. chelone, M. fortuitum, M. septicum, and M. smegmatis are part of this classification. M. abscessus was very common in cystic fibrosis patient in which it gave chronic nodular cavities.  ● Slow growing mycobacteria: include M. avium Complex (avium, intracellulare and chimera)  and also M. xenopi. They usually grow in 40-50 days. ● Intermediate growing: grow in 7 to 10 days,  M. marinum ( causes skin lesions) and M. gordonae are part of this group.  There is not a direct PCR, so it is not possible to use just the sputum, but there the physician need to wait for the culture. In some cases the PCR may result negative. There are some specific types of PCR for NTM but are not always specific.   Apart from their ability to grow in standard culture for Mycobacteria, there is also a classification that relies on their pathogenicity (fig.1).  \n Fig. 1 \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n2 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  This classification is relevant because if you find a Mycobacterium fortuitum, which is usually not a pathogen, it means that there might have been contamination from the environment. While the Mycobacterium in the middle column of fig.1 may be pathogenic in hosts that are immunosuppressed. Others like M. kansasi or M. malmoense, instead, can cause diseases to non-immunosuppressed patients. There was a case of a young man in the field last week, which endured a Neurosurgery due to spinal injury. He got infected by M. fortuitum, probably due to infected water during surgery that was directly injected in the spine.  Fig. 2 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NTM AND MT ● Habitat: NTM are ubiquitous, they are found everywhere in the environment ( like soil and water).  ● Virulence: NTM are much less virulent, they are opportunistic microorganism and require an acceptable host, while MT is always a pathogen. ● Transmission: NTM transmission comes from the environment, exception made for M. abscessus has a potential human-to-human spread in patients with CF, and even from contact with animals (rare). MT has human-to-human spread (however M. bovis can spread from an animal but is a rare situation).  ● Sensitivity to antibiotics: the sensitivity to antibiotics is different for every NTM species, but globally there is resistance to pyrazinamide and most of them to isoniazid.   TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY OF NTM Fig. 3 NTM, as previously said, are ubiquitous and present in household, hospital water, bathrooms, potting soil, garden soil and household dust. Infection sources were identified matching genotypic profiles of clinical and environmental isolates.  The transmission of mycobacteria is probably related to the aerosolized particles from water. Showering instead of bathing increases the probability to be infected, as we inhale this aerosol that might be contaminated. Gardening is also not suggested to immunosuppressed patient because of NTM presence in soil. Moreover, cough is a route of transmission. The recent global increase in NTM suggest that its transmission is linked to human activities like trade.  The majority of NTM has been found in different environmental sources, the only exception is M. ulcerans that is highly pathogenic (will be dealt with later during the lesson). NTM has also the ability to create biofilms, therefore can stay in ice machine, heater-cooler machine for cardiac surgery (M.chimera), seat dusts, vacuum machines and cobwebs1. Transmission occurs by: ● inhalation (water/soil) ; ● ingestion (water/soil and food); ● contact (cutaneous lesions).  1 spider web. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n3 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  However, M.abscessus can be transmitted by human-to-human interaction which is usually rare2. Tap water is considered the major sources of human pathogens such as MAC, M. kansasii, M. xenopi, M. simiae and RGM.  Incidence is poorly defined, varies between 1 and 1.8 cases per 100000 inhabitants, can be as high as 200-400 per 100000 patients with COPD in certain areas of USA, in patients with chronic lung problem or in cystic fibrosis, which is the biggest risk factor and presents the highest incidence. That’s the reason why patients with CF are screened every year for the colonization of their upper and lower respiratory tract.  What is possible to understand from this slide is that according to the climate and the environment, there are different bacteria present in different countries. In high income country is usually more common to see NTM that TB, and it is believed that it may be due to:  - higher screening for NTM, so an higher diagnostic rate  - higher frequency in showering rather than bathing. if you bath you do not inhale a lot of water, while in the shower it directly get into yout cavities and increases the probability to get an NTM.   NTM AND AMEBAS3 An important aspect of NTM is that they are able to survive in amebas.  Amebas are able to phagocytize free-living bacteria and feed on them, but NTM can survive inside them, creating a sort of a niche in them that provides protection from external agents. Probably 88% of amebas in drinking water contain NTM4. These NTM found inside amebas showed an increased resistance to antibiotics, they probably underwent modifications in order to survive inside amebas. AEROSOL There is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis, linked to the use of hot tubs. So, patients using hot tubs, lifeguards and pool attendants, those working in indoor swimming pools with sprites and ionized aerosols are at risk for this disease. Such a pneumonitis in a clinical case might be misleading but it is most probably an immune reaction to aerosolized hot water containing NTM rather than a spread infection.  PERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION Person to person transmission is a very debatable topic that was raised by a paper written in 2012 by Aitken. He reported a case of a 22 years old man having M. abscessus for 7 years. He transferred to Seattle and 8 months later 4 additional patients with the same species in sputum and same genetic background of this M. abscessus were found (although they had been negative to M. abscessus for years). None of these 5 people had any social interaction, however 4 of them had an overlapping clinic visit the same day. Therefore, following this and due to the potential transmission of M.abscessus in a setting of CF, there is an indication to deal with them as they are contagious: wearing a surgical mask and opening windows at the end of the day after visiting these patients.  This is the only reported case of person-to-person transmission.   PREDISPOSING FACTORS Some predisposing and risk factors have been identified: ● Bacterial load: how much NTM is inhaled or ingested;  2 Integrated with the slides 3 Amoeba is a free-living, freshwater-associated protozoans that are ubiquitously found in water systems - From the slides 4 the data derive from an year-long sampling study.  12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n4 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  ● Long-term colonization: if you leave them for long time, they may cause disease;  ● Immune response: immuno-depressed patients (HIV+, rheumatological disorders);  ● Previous state of organ and tissue: patients with chronic lung diseases have a microenvironment that favors infection of NTM; ● Concomitant systemic disease: for example, ciliary clearance5 or cystic fibrosis; ● Morphotype: it includes low BMI, scoliosis, “pectus excavatum”, mitral prolapse. These conditions may indicate a genetic predisposition associated with a higher risk of infection. Fig.4  shows how the incidence of NTM changes in different cases.   In cases of cystic fibrosis, NTM incidence is 4/5 times higher; in immune system diseases, it is 2 times higher; in tuberculosis it is 5 times higher; Aspergillus 3 times; in COPD 28 times higher; and lastly, as shown on the graph, higher incidence is observed in elderly and females.  Fig. 4  NTM AND HIV Fig. 5 The knowledge of NTM in infectious disease comes from HIV, in which it was mostly a disseminated disease from M. Avium Complex. It has a medium/high incidence: 10-20% in patients with AIDS patients without treatment, mostly because of CD4+ numbers decrease (low WBC count), but it decreases significantly in patients under HAART.  NTM in AIDS patients are correlated with high mortality, therefore prophylaxis with clarithromycin (1000mg/die) and azithromycin (12000 mg/week) is highly suggested.  An important element is that according to data from the EU,  there is still 20% patients presenting with AIDS, 30% late presentation with less than 350 CD4+/mm3, meaning that there is still an high possibility for newly HIV positive patients to develop NTM (as shown in fig.5).     5 He probably meant an IMPAIRED ciliary clearance as for example in Immotile Cilia Syndrome. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n5 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  CLINICAL CASE  Fig. 6 Fig. 6 is a CT scan of a patient with AIDS  hospitalized last year. He presented late, with less than 100 CD4 lymphocytes count. Although it wasn’t possible to find any sign of infection, in the CT scan, a nodule is visible with a round glass appearance6 around the nodule. A BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) was performed, in which fungi and neutrophils were found, culture for candida albicans was positive7. Candida pneumonia leads to a severe situation observed in neutropenic and immuno-depressed patients. Moreover, tests for PJ (pneumocystis) was negative and CMV DNA were found in low copies. After four weeks it was confirmed that the culture for Mycobacterium avium was positive.   Therefore, this was a MAC pneumonia in an AIDS patient without a disseminated disease, just localized in the lungs.  the figure below shows a graph that results from a study conducted in Catalonia, where they monitored the incidence of several NTM over time. One can see that M.kansasii was the most frequent in HIV+ patients until 2004. The introduction HAART lead to a better state of HIV+ patients, there is a steep increase in 2 NTM: MAC (red) and abscessus (blue). There is also a difference between the diagnosis of MAC (MAC isolation) and and the pulmonary/disseminated disease, suggesting that in most of the cases there is just a colonization. Treating HIV+ patients and improving their condition changed also the ecology 8 of NTM in the region. Fig. 7 In fig.8 you can see anti-INFγ antibodies, which are one of the pathways involved in favouring NTM replication observed in Sjogren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Some patients with immunological disorders have antibodies against INF-γ that may favor NTM, therefore they have high risk of developing NTM pulmonary disease. \n 6 This is exactly what he said, although it is not so clear what does it mean. 7 Remember that candida albicans is usually on skin and several mucoses, finding it in the bronchi means that it was brought it there from the oral cavity during the BAL procedure. 8 \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n6 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini   There have been several studies that tried to find out which genetic variants are associated with high risk of NTM9. It is relevant to remember that CFTR (the protein involved in cystic fibrosis) is also a risk factor itself, so when NTM pulmonary disease is diagnosed, doctors discuss with pulmonologist about the risk of an adult onset of cystic fibrosis. Fig. 8  CO-INFECTIONS Several co-infections were reported, such as the one with Aspergillus or CMV. Moreover, 10 to 30% patients with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis has a co-infection with NTM and sometimes it can be misdiagnosed. The two infections have a longer time of incubation and are harder to treat.  NTM RISK IN IMMUNO-DEPRESSED HOST Immuno-depressed patients/hosts present:  -  a higher risk of developing NTM pulmonary disease; -  a less acute clinical presentation and the treatment is more difficult because of drug interactions with immunosuppressant drugs, or because of side effects.  Talking about a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, he has a risk of having NTM is around 164.8 /100K, if he is on treatment for rheumatoid arthritis it’s risk almost double. Usually patients get diagnosed years later.   IMMUNO-DEPRESSED HOSTS ARE THOSE THAT PRESENT:  - Solid organ transplant; - Hematological malignancies;  - Autoimmune disorders; - Treatment for many of the aforementioned issues. Drugs that prevent graft versus host disease or avoid complication of bone marrow transplant can lead to immunocompromising. For example, in Rheumatoid arthritis10 patients, the risk seems to be around 164,8 over 100000 patients, but in those treated with drugs the risk is almost double (240/100000). So, both the condition and the treatment increase the predisposition of develop NTM pulmonary disease.  SJOGREN’S DISEASE In Sjogren’s disease there is a prevalence of 1% of NTM. It is not as common as in rheumatoid arthritis, but it appears usually during the first year after the diagnosis and is associated with aggressive immunosuppression correlated to methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. However, we don’t know if it is a drug side-effect or proxy of a more aggressive disease.     9 professors said that this figure is just for those of us who are interested in genetics.  10 autoimmune disorder \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n7 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  CLINICAL PRESENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH NTM  \n Fig. 9  In the left column of fig.9, there are the six most common presentations of NTM are shown and the species of Mycobacterium that cause them are divided in most common and less common. The six most common diseases are explained below.  Chronic bronchopulmonary disease is the most common disease in HIV negative11 individuals, the most frequent NTM that lead to it are: M. avium complex, M. xenopi (Central Europe), M. malmoense (North Europe), M. kansasii (US); M. abscessus; M. immunogenum (contaminated bronchoscopies)12.  ● Incidence: Incidence seems to be low but can be higher in some population than in other. For example, in USA and japan it is 1,3 cases each year per 100k inhabitants, while in Svizzera is 0,9 cases each year per 100k inhabitants.13  ● Risk factors: There are multiple risk factors: smoking, alcohol, previous TB, HIV, bronchiectasis, cancers, silicosis, cystic fibrosis, alveolar proteinosis.  Also medications and treatment for other diseases may be a risk factor   ● Pathogenesis: First event is the inhalation of Mycobacterium, after months or years there is the development of an alveolar infection (takes less time if there is an altered pulmonary clearance), then there is the development of granulomas. (from the slides) You might see granulomas or incomplete granulomas and they might, but they are non-producing caseum (differently from MT)  ● Clinical presentation: Clinical presentation includes specific sign and symptoms with a subacute/chronic clinical course: chronic productive cough (80%), asthenia, weight loss (50%), night sweating (20%), fever (10% - not so common),  11 HIV negative. 12 there is a geographical difference for the other species.  13 from slide 22. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n8 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  hemoptysis, malaise and dyspnea.  Recognizing the presentation may not be easy because of how heterogeneity is present. You can see different types of presentations, like some very painful nodules, which may be present both in arms and legs. Sometimes there may be cavities produced.    An example may be M. Marinum. This type of lesion is typical of some tropical diseases, it takes months to develop and it is not painful. Usually it gets to a very severe stage due to the lack of diagnosis and treatment in that geographic area.   Lastly this is the case of mycobacterium chimaera, and specifically there was an epidemic in the field after cardiac surgery due to contaminated surgical tools.   DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on two elements: radiological imaging and microbiological criteria. So, diagnosis is made thanks to chest x-ray, CT (HRCT), sputum staining and culture (at least two positive culture for the same NTM), BAL. PCR is in development (from slides). In chest X-ray presents fibro-nodular or cavitary lesions, usually located in the upper lobes. These two, cavitation and nodules, are the most common elements observable in an X-rays. Cavitation are also more common in this situation than in TB, but their appearance is different: thinner cavity wall and a larger dimension14. There may be also a bilateral pleural thickening in 50% of the cases. Pleural effusion is almost never observed. Diagnosis is usually made with the CT scan in which you can see bronchiectasis. The presence of nodular lesion, bronchiectasis and the clinical presentation point towards the diagnosis of NTM. Diagnostic Criteria of the American Thoracic Society The American Thoracic Society divides the diagnostic criteria in clinical and microbiological.  There are also some physical characteristics typical in patients, which include pectus excavatum, and low BMI.     MICROBIOLOGICAL CRITERIA IS THE MOST IMPORTANT: 1. Positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples. So, if you isolate MAC and then chimera or if you have isolated MAC (from here onwards this is the acronym used for Mycobacterium Avium Complex) and gordone, the result is not valid. This is because the same culture from 2 different sputum sample is needed. If the results from a single one is non-diagnostic, consider repeat sputum AFB smears and cultures. 2. Positive culture result from at least 1 bronchial wash or lavage. 3. Transbronchial or other lung biopsy with mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and positive culture for NTM or biopsy showing mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and one or more sputum or bronchial washings that are culture positive for NTM. 4. Expert consultation should be obtained when NTM are recovered that are either infrequently encountered or that usually represent environmental contamination. 5. Patients who are suspected of having NTM lung disease but do not meet the diagnostic criteria should be followed until the diagnosis is firmly established or excluded.15  14 with respect to the TB ones. 15 From the slides 12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n9 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  6. Making the diagnosis of NTM lung disease does not, per se, necessitate the institution of therapy, which is a decision based on potential risks and benefits of therapy for individual patients.  CLINICAL FINDINGS IN THE RADIOLOGICAL IMAGING In the first two chest x-rays, consolidation is observed. (fig, 11) In the second chest x-rays, cavitation can be appreciated. [fig.12] Some CT scans show a massive involvement very similar to TB. [fig.13] Bronchiectasis, some nodules and minimal disease (mostly in the medial lobe of the right lung). [fig.14 and fig.15] There might be both nodules and cavitation.  In the last CT scan, there is a large cavitation with a thin wall: this is a situation that make suspect NTM or aspergilloma. These two conditions can even coexist and the treatment is very complicated. [fig.17] Fig. 18  CLINICAL VARIANTS OF CHRONIC BRONCOPULMONARY DISEASES:   1. Cystic Fibrosis  2. Lady Windermere Syndrome, which is a chronic pulmonary NTM disease, usually is observed in female patient over 50 years old with no previous concomitant pulmonary disease. Lady Windermere syndrome is characterized by chronic cough with no constitutional symptoms and mild lung involvement, few nodules and bronchiectasis. It is a monolateral disease and cavitation are found in only 25% of the cases. There is a very strong association between this syndrome and depression. The disease is named after the character of the Oscar Wilde novel.  3. Hypersensitivity pneumonia: inhalation of an aerosol of heated water containing MAC. In the CT scan there is mostly an interstitial involvement of the two lungs. Fig. 19  II. NMT LYMPHADENITIS NMT Lymphadenitis will be dealt with starting with its presentation in HIV negative patients, and then HIV positive patients. Fig. 20  2.1 NTM Lymphadenitis in HIV-negative patients: NTM Lymphadenitis is common in children. The most frequent one is MAC. Usually there is an involvement of the anterior laterocervical lymph nodes, it is monolateral, non-painful and without fever in most cases. There could be an involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes. In some children there is a fast clinical course and risk of fistulation.  Mantoux test is intermediate: between 5 and 10mm, sometimes more than 10mm.  Some research used \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n10 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  intradermal reaction to MAC antigens, but it is not part of the clinical practice, yet. Fig. 21   Fig. 22 Diagnosis is usually made with an excision biopsy or fine needle biopsy of the lymph node from which the culture is then performed, although it is often negative. Pathology: granulomas without caseous center (sometimes with) ± AFB (Ziehl-Neelsen, PCR on tissue slices). Differential Diagnosis: TB lymphadenitis, cat-scratch disease (Bartonella), lymphomas, Toxoplasmosis, EBV, Metastatic tumors.  Treatment: consists of lymph node excision, which is usually enough, but in some scenarios a combination of antibiotics is needed.  Example: a cervical submandibular adenitis with fistulation. It presents red skin and infection.  There can be abdominal lymph node involvement; the symptoms present in this case are abdominal pain and maybe fever.     2.2 NTM Lymphadenitis in HIV positive patients:  NTM Lymphadenitis is observed in patient with AIDS or severe immune-depression, it might present itself as IRIS16. It is mostly a painful lymphadenitis with fever due to its systemic nature. Usually the involvement of deep lymph nodes causes abdominal pain.  Diagnosis: with this presentation abdominal CT scan is useful to get an idea of what’s going on.  Often biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and exclude alternative disorders.  There can be involvement of abdominal, lateral and cervical lymph nodes.  Fig 22 shows an HIV positive patient with an over clavicular mass. In the CT scan shown in fig.21 it is possible to see a colliqued collection, and a communication with the lung. Usually it is either a pleural nodule or a lung nodule that opens up outside and the biopsy will be positive for a non-caseous granuloma.   III. DISSEMINATED DISEASE IN HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS In HIV+ patients with advanced disease - AIDS patients - there is also a disseminated disease most commonly caused by MAC. This is a very late presentation, when CD4+ count is below 50/mm3, in particular the median count is of 13 CD4/mm3 (for reference, HIV negative patients have between 800 to 1400 CD4+ count). Patients present with:  ● Very high fever, weight loss, night sweat, abdominal pain, diarrhea and diffuse lymphadenitis.  ● Often there is liver and spleen enlargement, while lung involvement is not that common (10% of the cases with alveolar infiltrates, nodules, cavitation). Potentially involvement of: suprarenal glands, stomach, GI, bone marrow (often found in Mycobacterium blood culture or bone marrow aspirate). ● Laboratories abnormalities include pancytopenia (anemia is the most relevant) and elevated alkaline phosphatase.   Disseminated disease is present in other immuno-depressed patients such as: ● Transplant patients; ● Solid and bone marrow transplant recipients;  16 IRIS: Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n11 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  ● Chronic steroid treatment; ● LLC (chronic lymphocytic leukemia); ● Congenital immune-depression in children (highest if deficits of IFN-γ and IL-12 receptor and IL-12 deficits).   Diagnosis: usually based on positive hemoculture for mycobacteria (BACTEC, with a liquid culture ground, with sensitivity > 90%), biopsy of lymph node, in certain cases of pancytopenia culture from bone marrow aspirate, liver/spleen biopsy («Myco-f-lytic» means) -> 8-14 days, specific PCR. Differential diagnosis includes TB, CMV, Salmonella infections, lymphomas, wasting syndrome, malignancies and rare fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis.  IV. SKIN AND SOFT TISSUES INFECTIONS Skin and soft tissues infections are mostly related to RGM (rapid growing mycobacterium): M. fortuitum, chelonae, abscessus; M. marinum, which appear either after trauma or over dermatological lesions; and M. ulcerans; MAC which are less common. RGM:  ● M. fortuitum: chronic skin ulcers after traumas (sharp metals, motorbike accidents) mostly to feet and legs, pimples after «skin care», post-surgical (plastic surgery). ● M. chelonae: immunodepressed hosts (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, chronic steroid use) or «over» skin lesions. ● M.abscessus: immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts, skin lesions, spondylitis.17 Fig. 23 shows: example of lesions. They are not painful and often tend to become chronic ulcers with time, and that’s the reason why biopsy is performed to have a diagnosis.   \nFig. 23  Two other less rapid growing mycobacterium can give skin and soft tissues infections, shown in fig.24:  ● M. marinum: mostly seen in patients handling fish tanks (contaminated water/fishes). This mycobacterium presents an incubation period of 2-3 weeks. It’s infection presents with papular lesions on hands and arms (ulcers).  The diagnosis is done through history and biopsy (histology + culture). ● M. haemophilum: immunosuppressed skin papula lesions and ulcers on arms and legs.18  17 From the slides 18 From the slides \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n12 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  ● M. ulcerans: called also Buruli’s ulcer. It is a tropical disease with a very long incubation period (8-12 weeks). Nodular lesions over time can transform into destroying ulceras (mostly lower limbs), causing debilitating lesions. These lesions are not painful. In slide 55 you can find a map of the diffusion of this agent. The areas that are mainly affected are: tropical countries, Africa, Central America and Australia. \nFig. 24  In fig.25 there are other example of lesions. Nodules and ulcers are visible, specially the devastating ulcers. Ulcers can appear in arms, ears, thorax or everywhere. These lesions are very hard to be treated, surgical approach is sometimes needed.    \nFig. 25   V. BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS Bone and joint infections are chronic inflammation with granulomas, usually coming from direct inoculation from traumas, surgical procedures, injections. Many species are associated with these infections:  ● MAC, M. marinum: hand (tenosinovitis) infection; ● M. chelonae, M. haemophilum: immuno-depressed, potential disseminated disease; ● M. haemophilum: bone and joints, usually with skin fistulizations and bacteremia; ● M. fortuitum, M. abscessus: sternal osteomyelitis after cardiac surgery.19  Diagnosis requires Biopsy and culture.   VI. CVC OR PERITONEAL CATHETERS INFECTIONS  19 From the slides (the professor did not mention them) \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n13 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  CVC or peritoneal catheters infections are usually caused by RGM (M. fortuitum, chelonae, abscessus). Clinical presentation includes: ● fever; ● secretions from the insertion site; ● bacteremia;  ● secondary infiltrates in other organs like lung or liver, where can specifically lead to granulomatous hepatitis.  Therapy: Therapeutic strategies consist in CVC/catheter removal and antibiotics directed specifically against the species isolated (6-12 weeks).  MYCOBACTERIUM CHIMAERA (MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM COMPLEX) M. chimera is included in MAC, but it can be genetically differentiated from Mycobacterium Avium and Mycobacterium Intracellulare. Recently, it’s been shown that disseminated M.chimera infection can be associated with heater-cooler units after cardiac surgery such as aortic valve surgery without endocarditis.   Fig. 26 presents a review where all the cases related to heater-cooler units are reported. It is interesting to note the very long latency, meaning that from surgery to the appearance of symptoms elapsed months or even years (up to 6 or 7 years). While from symptoms to diagnosis elapsed even 1.6 years. This means that it’s not easy to recognise M. chimera as causative agent of infections in patients that have undergone cardiac surgery months or years before. \n Fig. 26  Fig. 27 Clinical manifestation years after surgery includes:  ● Fever (80%), malaise (80%), weight loss (60%), cough (37%), and dyspnea (33%); ● Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and chorioretinitis; ● Cytopenias which is similar to disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients; ● Elevated inflammatory markers, transaminase levels, and creatinine; ● Histopathology is consistent with granulomatous lesions, including dissemination to several organs leading to hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, chorioretinitis, myocarditis, osteomyelitis, and myositis. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n14 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini   In Fig.27 of a periaortic debris, there is a thick biofilm. It is difficult to diagnose and treat unless tissue is removed. Fig. 28  Laboratory assessment: The gold standard for diagnosis is a M.chimera-positive cultures obtained from an invasive sample (blood, pus, tissue biopsy, or implanted prosthetic material).  Clinical assessment: The diagnosis should moreover include: ● Prosthetic valve endocarditis; ● Prosthetic vascular graft infection; ● Sternotomy wound infection; ● Mediastinitis; ● Bloodstream infection; ● Disseminated infection, including embolic and immunologic manifestations (splenomegaly, arthritis, osteomyelitis, bone marrow involvement with cytopenia, chorioretinitis, lung involvement, hepatitis, nephritis, myocarditis) . Therefore, it is very hard to diagnose it. Exposure assessment: If the past medical history include surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, an infection from M. chimera should be taken into account, either disseminated or affecting a single organ.   TREATMENT OF NTM INFECTIONS The following are some of the principles of treatment. The treatment for NTM is very long: guidelines suggest 12 months from negative cultures, and it might take between from 18 to 24 months. Moreover, all the drugs present significant side effects and poor efficacy rates. The following should be taken into consideration when prescribing medications:  ● ATS criteria for infection versus colonization; ● We should always weigh benefits and potential harms in terms of radiological and clinical microbiological outcome; ● Patients should be involved in the treatment decision and should be informed that the treatment could take 2 years and that there could be side effects.  ● The type of patients must be considered, their lifestyles,their age, their comorbidities. In fact, a 40 years old patient with cystic fibrosis will require a different treatment with respect to a 90 years old woman that just reports asthenia.  There are very few RCT20 guide treatment, therefore, dosage or amount of drugs to be taken and the length of the treatment changes according to the species, severity of the disease and concomitant disorders. Usually the treatment is a combination of macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) plus ethambutol and rifabutin/rifampicin. Thus, is a standard 3 drug regimen, and every species has a different set of drugs. For instance, M. abscessus had a completely different regimen that involves 4 weeks of Intravenous therapy at  20 Randomized clinical trials  \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n15 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  the beginning and then continuous therapy with oral drugs.  Fig. 29 The guidelines of the American Thoracic Society  and the British Thoracic Society represent the best source of knowledge for the clinical management of these infections.21 As shown in figure 20  the outcomes are poor, even using the 3 drugs regimen for MAC- correlated pulmonary disease, 40% of the patients doesn’t survive (32% for all causes while only in 8% deaths is related to mycobacterium),16% risk of relapse and the percentage of 5 years survival is only 27%. Recap: very long treatment, side effects present and poor outcomes.  FAILURE Failure should be distinguished in three fields: ● Clinical failure: patients do not improve, although the microbiological picture improves; ● Microbiological failure with non-sputum conversion: all the selection resistance22 ● Radiological failure: lesions do not improve or even worsen under treatment. Outcomes are set with the patient, if after a year we do not have improvement with this treatment, the outcomes may be weighted again with the patient and he should be involved in the decision regarding his future treatment. The rate of failure and/or relapse: ● MAC-PD presents a failure rate around 13-16% with 3-drug regimen, which is not very high. Up to 48% in some case series, the rate of reinfection is very high, around 75%. Higher incidence if previously treated, macrolide resistance, non-sputum conversion after 6 months. Better outcomes by adding «new» drugs (fluoroquinolones,     clofazimine, linezolid). ● M. Abscessus-PD presents a failure rate of 42% with standard treatment (4 weeks i.v. plus maintenance). Further distinguishing between M. abs. abscessus and M. abs. massiliense, the former present a failure rate of 75%, whereas the latter of 22%. Therefore M. abs. abscessus is the most difficult to treat. Relapse rates are: 24-42% con 1/2 iv drugs 58% in Myc abs abscessus vs. 5% in Myc abs   massiliense. 52% in the US23  INHALED LIPOSOMIAL AMIKACIN There are several trials for new drugs, including those discussed for resistance TB: bedaquiline, clofazimine and lanesolate, tenozalide . The only very specific drug for NTM in development (not already approved by the FDA) and evaluation under EMA is inhaled liposomal amikacin. Amikacin is used for the treatment of NTM, but Intravenous amikacin has the disadvantage that it must be given IV in day hospital. Moreover, it is associated with renal insufficiency that may be irreversible and also with ear toxicity (ototoxicity), leading to several symptoms and correlated with a genetic predisposition. Using inhaled liposomal amikacin renal  21 These guidelines present complete informations on every single species. They are not required to be read for the exam but keep in mind that whenever there’s a doubt on a treatment for a particularly rare species, these are the literature that doctors refer to. 22 Audio at slide 68 (microbiological failure at the time 00:09 min) - Not so clear. 23 Everything in Italic is integrated from the slides \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n16 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  insufficiency is totally avoided, while IR toxicity is only partially avoided. The liposomal formulation increases the amount of drugs that get inside alveolar macrophages (which are the target sites) and decreases the amount of drugs that is systemic available, thus affecting the tolerability of the patient.    TREATMENT OF MACROLIDE-R MAC-PD. We should always ask to the laboratory if our NTM is resistant or susceptible to macrolides. Macrolides are the cornerstone. Moreover, there is a genetic association, meaning that there is a genetic probe that will indicate if the NTM is resistant. It is a slow and complex phenotypic test, therefore only few laboratories are able to perform this phenotypic assessment of NTM susceptibility to drugs.   In case of MAC-pulmonary disease, that is macrolide resistant, in which the efficacy is around 20%, a combination of four drugs is used: rifampicin, ethambutol, ionized FQ/clofazimine and inhaled amikacin.  In case of M. abscessus PD (macrolide resistant) there are few weeks of intravenous treatment and a very long phase of oral drugs, including new drugs. However, there are side effects: linezolid is a very powerful anti-Gram+ drug and is associated with peripheral neuropathy, anemia and thrombocytopenia, so is hard to use it for 2 years. Almost all these drugs have side effects that make it difficult to have a long-term treatment based on them.

The second reason is that in certain countries (USA included) the incidence of NTM pulmonary disease is higher than the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. In Italy we don’t have epidemiological data to compare the two diseases, but it’s probably the same. The definition of NTM is a negative one: NTM comprehend all the species other than: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. bovis, M. caprae, M. microti, M. leprae (etiological agent of leprosy), M. pinnipedii, M. canettii.   There are more than 150 species, of which 60 are considered pathological for humans. Most of them to be pathological require a very strong immune depression, this is why they are common in ospital. The severity of the pathogen can also be imagined by the velocity of growth. how quickly they grow tells us about how quickly they can create issues in the organisms.   CLASSIFICATION There are two kind of classification for NTM.  The first one classifies them into: ● Rapid growing mycobacteria: grow in less than 7 days. Further divided in: 1. pigmented; 2. non pigmented, which are very important, because M. abscessus, M. chelone, M. fortuitum, M. septicum, and M. smegmatis are part of this classification. M. abscessus was very common in cystic fibrosis patient in which it gave chronic nodular cavities.  ● Slow growing mycobacteria: include M. avium Complex (avium, intracellulare and chimera)  and also M. xenopi. They usually grow in 40-50 days. ● Intermediate growing: grow in 7 to 10 days,  M. marinum ( causes skin lesions) and M. gordonae are part of this group.  There is not a direct PCR, so it is not possible to use just the sputum, but there the physician need to wait for the culture. In some cases the PCR may result negative. There are some specific types of PCR for NTM but are not always specific.   Apart from their ability to grow in standard culture for Mycobacteria, there is also a classification that relies on their pathogenicity (fig.1).  \n Fig. 1 \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n2 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  This classification is relevant because if you find a Mycobacterium fortuitum, which is usually not a pathogen, it means that there might have been contamination from the environment. While the Mycobacterium in the middle column of fig.1 may be pathogenic in hosts that are immunosuppressed. Others like M. kansasi or M. malmoense, instead, can cause diseases to non-immunosuppressed patients. There was a case of a young man in the field last week, which endured a Neurosurgery due to spinal injury. He got infected by M. fortuitum, probably due to infected water during surgery that was directly injected in the spine.  Fig. 2 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NTM AND MT ● Habitat: NTM are ubiquitous, they are found everywhere in the environment ( like soil and water).  ● Virulence: NTM are much less virulent, they are opportunistic microorganism and require an acceptable host, while MT is always a pathogen. ● Transmission: NTM transmission comes from the environment, exception made for M. abscessus has a potential human-to-human spread in patients with CF, and even from contact with animals (rare). MT has human-to-human spread (however M. bovis can spread from an animal but is a rare situation).  ● Sensitivity to antibiotics: the sensitivity to antibiotics is different for every NTM species, but globally there is resistance to pyrazinamide and most of them to isoniazid.   TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY OF NTM Fig. 3 NTM, as previously said, are ubiquitous and present in household, hospital water, bathrooms, potting soil, garden soil and household dust. Infection sources were identified matching genotypic profiles of clinical and environmental isolates.  The transmission of mycobacteria is probably related to the aerosolized particles from water. Showering instead of bathing increases the probability to be infected, as we inhale this aerosol that might be contaminated. Gardening is also not suggested to immunosuppressed patient because of NTM presence in soil. Moreover, cough is a route of transmission. The recent global increase in NTM suggest that its transmission is linked to human activities like trade.  The majority of NTM has been found in different environmental sources, the only exception is M. ulcerans that is highly pathogenic (will be dealt with later during the lesson). NTM has also the ability to create biofilms, therefore can stay in ice machine, heater-cooler machine for cardiac surgery (M.chimera), seat dusts, vacuum machines and cobwebs1. Transmission occurs by: ● inhalation (water/soil) ; ● ingestion (water/soil and food); ● contact (cutaneous lesions).  1 spider web. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n3 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  However, M.abscessus can be transmitted by human-to-human interaction which is usually rare2. Tap water is considered the major sources of human pathogens such as MAC, M. kansasii, M. xenopi, M. simiae and RGM.  Incidence is poorly defined, varies between 1 and 1.8 cases per 100000 inhabitants, can be as high as 200-400 per 100000 patients with COPD in certain areas of USA, in patients with chronic lung problem or in cystic fibrosis, which is the biggest risk factor and presents the highest incidence. That’s the reason why patients with CF are screened every year for the colonization of their upper and lower respiratory tract.  What is possible to understand from this slide is that according to the climate and the environment, there are different bacteria present in different countries. In high income country is usually more common to see NTM that TB, and it is believed that it may be due to:  - higher screening for NTM, so an higher diagnostic rate  - higher frequency in showering rather than bathing. if you bath you do not inhale a lot of water, while in the shower it directly get into yout cavities and increases the probability to get an NTM.   NTM AND AMEBAS3 An important aspect of NTM is that they are able to survive in amebas.  Amebas are able to phagocytize free-living bacteria and feed on them, but NTM can survive inside them, creating a sort of a niche in them that provides protection from external agents. Probably 88% of amebas in drinking water contain NTM4. These NTM found inside amebas showed an increased resistance to antibiotics, they probably underwent modifications in order to survive inside amebas. AEROSOL There is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis, linked to the use of hot tubs. So, patients using hot tubs, lifeguards and pool attendants, those working in indoor swimming pools with sprites and ionized aerosols are at risk for this disease. Such a pneumonitis in a clinical case might be misleading but it is most probably an immune reaction to aerosolized hot water containing NTM rather than a spread infection.  PERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION Person to person transmission is a very debatable topic that was raised by a paper written in 2012 by Aitken. He reported a case of a 22 years old man having M. abscessus for 7 years. He transferred to Seattle and 8 months later 4 additional patients with the same species in sputum and same genetic background of this M. abscessus were found (although they had been negative to M. abscessus for years). None of these 5 people had any social interaction, however 4 of them had an overlapping clinic visit the same day. Therefore, following this and due to the potential transmission of M.abscessus in a setting of CF, there is an indication to deal with them as they are contagious: wearing a surgical mask and opening windows at the end of the day after visiting these patients.  This is the only reported case of person-to-person transmission.   PREDISPOSING FACTORS Some predisposing and risk factors have been identified: ● Bacterial load: how much NTM is inhaled or ingested;  2 Integrated with the slides 3 Amoeba is a free-living, freshwater-associated protozoans that are ubiquitously found in water systems - From the slides 4 the data derive from an year-long sampling study.  12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n4 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  ● Long-term colonization: if you leave them for long time, they may cause disease;  ● Immune response: immuno-depressed patients (HIV+, rheumatological disorders);  ● Previous state of organ and tissue: patients with chronic lung diseases have a microenvironment that favors infection of NTM; ● Concomitant systemic disease: for example, ciliary clearance5 or cystic fibrosis; ● Morphotype: it includes low BMI, scoliosis, “pectus excavatum”, mitral prolapse. These conditions may indicate a genetic predisposition associated with a higher risk of infection. Fig.4  shows how the incidence of NTM changes in different cases.   In cases of cystic fibrosis, NTM incidence is 4/5 times higher; in immune system diseases, it is 2 times higher; in tuberculosis it is 5 times higher; Aspergillus 3 times; in COPD 28 times higher; and lastly, as shown on the graph, higher incidence is observed in elderly and females.  Fig. 4  NTM AND HIV Fig. 5 The knowledge of NTM in infectious disease comes from HIV, in which it was mostly a disseminated disease from M. Avium Complex. It has a medium/high incidence: 10-20% in patients with AIDS patients without treatment, mostly because of CD4+ numbers decrease (low WBC count), but it decreases significantly in patients under HAART.  NTM in AIDS patients are correlated with high mortality, therefore prophylaxis with clarithromycin (1000mg/die) and azithromycin (12000 mg/week) is highly suggested.  An important element is that according to data from the EU,  there is still 20% patients presenting with AIDS, 30% late presentation with less than 350 CD4+/mm3, meaning that there is still an high possibility for newly HIV positive patients to develop NTM (as shown in fig.5).     5 He probably meant an IMPAIRED ciliary clearance as for example in Immotile Cilia Syndrome. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n5 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  CLINICAL CASE  Fig. 6 Fig. 6 is a CT scan of a patient with AIDS  hospitalized last year. He presented late, with less than 100 CD4 lymphocytes count. Although it wasn’t possible to find any sign of infection, in the CT scan, a nodule is visible with a round glass appearance6 around the nodule. A BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) was performed, in which fungi and neutrophils were found, culture for candida albicans was positive7. Candida pneumonia leads to a severe situation observed in neutropenic and immuno-depressed patients. Moreover, tests for PJ (pneumocystis) was negative and CMV DNA were found in low copies. After four weeks it was confirmed that the culture for Mycobacterium avium was positive.   Therefore, this was a MAC pneumonia in an AIDS patient without a disseminated disease, just localized in the lungs.  the figure below shows a graph that results from a study conducted in Catalonia, where they monitored the incidence of several NTM over time. One can see that M.kansasii was the most frequent in HIV+ patients until 2004. The introduction HAART lead to a better state of HIV+ patients, there is a steep increase in 2 NTM: MAC (red) and abscessus (blue). There is also a difference between the diagnosis of MAC (MAC isolation) and and the pulmonary/disseminated disease, suggesting that in most of the cases there is just a colonization. Treating HIV+ patients and improving their condition changed also the ecology 8 of NTM in the region. Fig. 7 In fig.8 you can see anti-INFγ antibodies, which are one of the pathways involved in favouring NTM replication observed in Sjogren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Some patients with immunological disorders have antibodies against INF-γ that may favor NTM, therefore they have high risk of developing NTM pulmonary disease. \n 6 This is exactly what he said, although it is not so clear what does it mean. 7 Remember that candida albicans is usually on skin and several mucoses, finding it in the bronchi means that it was brought it there from the oral cavity during the BAL procedure. 8 \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n6 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini   There have been several studies that tried to find out which genetic variants are associated with high risk of NTM9. It is relevant to remember that CFTR (the protein involved in cystic fibrosis) is also a risk factor itself, so when NTM pulmonary disease is diagnosed, doctors discuss with pulmonologist about the risk of an adult onset of cystic fibrosis. Fig. 8  CO-INFECTIONS Several co-infections were reported, such as the one with Aspergillus or CMV. Moreover, 10 to 30% patients with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis has a co-infection with NTM and sometimes it can be misdiagnosed. The two infections have a longer time of incubation and are harder to treat.  NTM RISK IN IMMUNO-DEPRESSED HOST Immuno-depressed patients/hosts present:  -  a higher risk of developing NTM pulmonary disease; -  a less acute clinical presentation and the treatment is more difficult because of drug interactions with immunosuppressant drugs, or because of side effects.  Talking about a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, he has a risk of having NTM is around 164.8 /100K, if he is on treatment for rheumatoid arthritis it’s risk almost double. Usually patients get diagnosed years later.   IMMUNO-DEPRESSED HOSTS ARE THOSE THAT PRESENT:  - Solid organ transplant; - Hematological malignancies;  - Autoimmune disorders; - Treatment for many of the aforementioned issues. Drugs that prevent graft versus host disease or avoid complication of bone marrow transplant can lead to immunocompromising. For example, in Rheumatoid arthritis10 patients, the risk seems to be around 164,8 over 100000 patients, but in those treated with drugs the risk is almost double (240/100000). So, both the condition and the treatment increase the predisposition of develop NTM pulmonary disease.  SJOGREN’S DISEASE In Sjogren’s disease there is a prevalence of 1% of NTM. It is not as common as in rheumatoid arthritis, but it appears usually during the first year after the diagnosis and is associated with aggressive immunosuppression correlated to methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. However, we don’t know if it is a drug side-effect or proxy of a more aggressive disease.     9 professors said that this figure is just for those of us who are interested in genetics.  10 autoimmune disorder \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n7 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  CLINICAL PRESENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH NTM  \n Fig. 9  In the left column of fig.9, there are the six most common presentations of NTM are shown and the species of Mycobacterium that cause them are divided in most common and less common. The six most common diseases are explained below.  Chronic bronchopulmonary disease is the most common disease in HIV negative11 individuals, the most frequent NTM that lead to it are: M. avium complex, M. xenopi (Central Europe), M. malmoense (North Europe), M. kansasii (US); M. abscessus; M. immunogenum (contaminated bronchoscopies)12.  ● Incidence: Incidence seems to be low but can be higher in some population than in other. For example, in USA and japan it is 1,3 cases each year per 100k inhabitants, while in Svizzera is 0,9 cases each year per 100k inhabitants.13  ● Risk factors: There are multiple risk factors: smoking, alcohol, previous TB, HIV, bronchiectasis, cancers, silicosis, cystic fibrosis, alveolar proteinosis.  Also medications and treatment for other diseases may be a risk factor   ● Pathogenesis: First event is the inhalation of Mycobacterium, after months or years there is the development of an alveolar infection (takes less time if there is an altered pulmonary clearance), then there is the development of granulomas. (from the slides) You might see granulomas or incomplete granulomas and they might, but they are non-producing caseum (differently from MT)  ● Clinical presentation: Clinical presentation includes specific sign and symptoms with a subacute/chronic clinical course: chronic productive cough (80%), asthenia, weight loss (50%), night sweating (20%), fever (10% - not so common),  11 HIV negative. 12 there is a geographical difference for the other species.  13 from slide 22. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n8 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  hemoptysis, malaise and dyspnea.  Recognizing the presentation may not be easy because of how heterogeneity is present. You can see different types of presentations, like some very painful nodules, which may be present both in arms and legs. Sometimes there may be cavities produced.    An example may be M. Marinum. This type of lesion is typical of some tropical diseases, it takes months to develop and it is not painful. Usually it gets to a very severe stage due to the lack of diagnosis and treatment in that geographic area.   Lastly this is the case of mycobacterium chimaera, and specifically there was an epidemic in the field after cardiac surgery due to contaminated surgical tools.   DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on two elements: radiological imaging and microbiological criteria. So, diagnosis is made thanks to chest x-ray, CT (HRCT), sputum staining and culture (at least two positive culture for the same NTM), BAL. PCR is in development (from slides). In chest X-ray presents fibro-nodular or cavitary lesions, usually located in the upper lobes. These two, cavitation and nodules, are the most common elements observable in an X-rays. Cavitation are also more common in this situation than in TB, but their appearance is different: thinner cavity wall and a larger dimension14. There may be also a bilateral pleural thickening in 50% of the cases. Pleural effusion is almost never observed. Diagnosis is usually made with the CT scan in which you can see bronchiectasis. The presence of nodular lesion, bronchiectasis and the clinical presentation point towards the diagnosis of NTM. Diagnostic Criteria of the American Thoracic Society The American Thoracic Society divides the diagnostic criteria in clinical and microbiological.  There are also some physical characteristics typical in patients, which include pectus excavatum, and low BMI.     MICROBIOLOGICAL CRITERIA IS THE MOST IMPORTANT: 1. Positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples. So, if you isolate MAC and then chimera or if you have isolated MAC (from here onwards this is the acronym used for Mycobacterium Avium Complex) and gordone, the result is not valid. This is because the same culture from 2 different sputum sample is needed. If the results from a single one is non-diagnostic, consider repeat sputum AFB smears and cultures. 2. Positive culture result from at least 1 bronchial wash or lavage. 3. Transbronchial or other lung biopsy with mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and positive culture for NTM or biopsy showing mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and one or more sputum or bronchial washings that are culture positive for NTM. 4. Expert consultation should be obtained when NTM are recovered that are either infrequently encountered or that usually represent environmental contamination. 5. Patients who are suspected of having NTM lung disease but do not meet the diagnostic criteria should be followed until the diagnosis is firmly established or excluded.15  14 with respect to the TB ones. 15 From the slides 12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n9 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  6. Making the diagnosis of NTM lung disease does not, per se, necessitate the institution of therapy, which is a decision based on potential risks and benefits of therapy for individual patients.  CLINICAL FINDINGS IN THE RADIOLOGICAL IMAGING In the first two chest x-rays, consolidation is observed. (fig, 11) In the second chest x-rays, cavitation can be appreciated. [fig.12] Some CT scans show a massive involvement very similar to TB. [fig.13] Bronchiectasis, some nodules and minimal disease (mostly in the medial lobe of the right lung). [fig.14 and fig.15] There might be both nodules and cavitation.  In the last CT scan, there is a large cavitation with a thin wall: this is a situation that make suspect NTM or aspergilloma. These two conditions can even coexist and the treatment is very complicated. [fig.17] Fig. 18  CLINICAL VARIANTS OF CHRONIC BRONCOPULMONARY DISEASES:   1. Cystic Fibrosis  2. Lady Windermere Syndrome, which is a chronic pulmonary NTM disease, usually is observed in female patient over 50 years old with no previous concomitant pulmonary disease. Lady Windermere syndrome is characterized by chronic cough with no constitutional symptoms and mild lung involvement, few nodules and bronchiectasis. It is a monolateral disease and cavitation are found in only 25% of the cases. There is a very strong association between this syndrome and depression. The disease is named after the character of the Oscar Wilde novel.  3. Hypersensitivity pneumonia: inhalation of an aerosol of heated water containing MAC. In the CT scan there is mostly an interstitial involvement of the two lungs. Fig. 19  II. NMT LYMPHADENITIS NMT Lymphadenitis will be dealt with starting with its presentation in HIV negative patients, and then HIV positive patients. Fig. 20  2.1 NTM Lymphadenitis in HIV-negative patients: NTM Lymphadenitis is common in children. The most frequent one is MAC. Usually there is an involvement of the anterior laterocervical lymph nodes, it is monolateral, non-painful and without fever in most cases. There could be an involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes. In some children there is a fast clinical course and risk of fistulation.  Mantoux test is intermediate: between 5 and 10mm, sometimes more than 10mm.  Some research used \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n10 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  intradermal reaction to MAC antigens, but it is not part of the clinical practice, yet. Fig. 21   Fig. 22 Diagnosis is usually made with an excision biopsy or fine needle biopsy of the lymph node from which the culture is then performed, although it is often negative. Pathology: granulomas without caseous center (sometimes with) ± AFB (Ziehl-Neelsen, PCR on tissue slices). Differential Diagnosis: TB lymphadenitis, cat-scratch disease (Bartonella), lymphomas, Toxoplasmosis, EBV, Metastatic tumors.  Treatment: consists of lymph node excision, which is usually enough, but in some scenarios a combination of antibiotics is needed.  Example: a cervical submandibular adenitis with fistulation. It presents red skin and infection.  There can be abdominal lymph node involvement; the symptoms present in this case are abdominal pain and maybe fever.     2.2 NTM Lymphadenitis in HIV positive patients:  NTM Lymphadenitis is observed in patient with AIDS or severe immune-depression, it might present itself as IRIS16. It is mostly a painful lymphadenitis with fever due to its systemic nature. Usually the involvement of deep lymph nodes causes abdominal pain.  Diagnosis: with this presentation abdominal CT scan is useful to get an idea of what’s going on.  Often biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and exclude alternative disorders.  There can be involvement of abdominal, lateral and cervical lymph nodes.  Fig 22 shows an HIV positive patient with an over clavicular mass. In the CT scan shown in fig.21 it is possible to see a colliqued collection, and a communication with the lung. Usually it is either a pleural nodule or a lung nodule that opens up outside and the biopsy will be positive for a non-caseous granuloma.   III. DISSEMINATED DISEASE IN HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS In HIV+ patients with advanced disease - AIDS patients - there is also a disseminated disease most commonly caused by MAC. This is a very late presentation, when CD4+ count is below 50/mm3, in particular the median count is of 13 CD4/mm3 (for reference, HIV negative patients have between 800 to 1400 CD4+ count). Patients present with:  ● Very high fever, weight loss, night sweat, abdominal pain, diarrhea and diffuse lymphadenitis.  ● Often there is liver and spleen enlargement, while lung involvement is not that common (10% of the cases with alveolar infiltrates, nodules, cavitation). Potentially involvement of: suprarenal glands, stomach, GI, bone marrow (often found in Mycobacterium blood culture or bone marrow aspirate). ● Laboratories abnormalities include pancytopenia (anemia is the most relevant) and elevated alkaline phosphatase.   Disseminated disease is present in other immuno-depressed patients such as: ● Transplant patients; ● Solid and bone marrow transplant recipients;  16 IRIS: Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n11 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  ● Chronic steroid treatment; ● LLC (chronic lymphocytic leukemia); ● Congenital immune-depression in children (highest if deficits of IFN-γ and IL-12 receptor and IL-12 deficits).   Diagnosis: usually based on positive hemoculture for mycobacteria (BACTEC, with a liquid culture ground, with sensitivity > 90%), biopsy of lymph node, in certain cases of pancytopenia culture from bone marrow aspirate, liver/spleen biopsy («Myco-f-lytic» means) -> 8-14 days, specific PCR. Differential diagnosis includes TB, CMV, Salmonella infections, lymphomas, wasting syndrome, malignancies and rare fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis.  IV. SKIN AND SOFT TISSUES INFECTIONS Skin and soft tissues infections are mostly related to RGM (rapid growing mycobacterium): M. fortuitum, chelonae, abscessus; M. marinum, which appear either after trauma or over dermatological lesions; and M. ulcerans; MAC which are less common. RGM:  ● M. fortuitum: chronic skin ulcers after traumas (sharp metals, motorbike accidents) mostly to feet and legs, pimples after «skin care», post-surgical (plastic surgery). ● M. chelonae: immunodepressed hosts (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, chronic steroid use) or «over» skin lesions. ● M.abscessus: immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts, skin lesions, spondylitis.17 Fig. 23 shows: example of lesions. They are not painful and often tend to become chronic ulcers with time, and that’s the reason why biopsy is performed to have a diagnosis.   \nFig. 23  Two other less rapid growing mycobacterium can give skin and soft tissues infections, shown in fig.24:  ● M. marinum: mostly seen in patients handling fish tanks (contaminated water/fishes). This mycobacterium presents an incubation period of 2-3 weeks. It’s infection presents with papular lesions on hands and arms (ulcers).  The diagnosis is done through history and biopsy (histology + culture). ● M. haemophilum: immunosuppressed skin papula lesions and ulcers on arms and legs.18  17 From the slides 18 From the slides \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n12 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  ● M. ulcerans: called also Buruli’s ulcer. It is a tropical disease with a very long incubation period (8-12 weeks). Nodular lesions over time can transform into destroying ulceras (mostly lower limbs), causing debilitating lesions. These lesions are not painful. In slide 55 you can find a map of the diffusion of this agent. The areas that are mainly affected are: tropical countries, Africa, Central America and Australia. \nFig. 24  In fig.25 there are other example of lesions. Nodules and ulcers are visible, specially the devastating ulcers. Ulcers can appear in arms, ears, thorax or everywhere. These lesions are very hard to be treated, surgical approach is sometimes needed.    \nFig. 25   V. BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS Bone and joint infections are chronic inflammation with granulomas, usually coming from direct inoculation from traumas, surgical procedures, injections. Many species are associated with these infections:  ● MAC, M. marinum: hand (tenosinovitis) infection; ● M. chelonae, M. haemophilum: immuno-depressed, potential disseminated disease; ● M. haemophilum: bone and joints, usually with skin fistulizations and bacteremia; ● M. fortuitum, M. abscessus: sternal osteomyelitis after cardiac surgery.19  Diagnosis requires Biopsy and culture.   VI. CVC OR PERITONEAL CATHETERS INFECTIONS  19 From the slides (the professor did not mention them) \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n13 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  CVC or peritoneal catheters infections are usually caused by RGM (M. fortuitum, chelonae, abscessus). Clinical presentation includes: ● fever; ● secretions from the insertion site; ● bacteremia;  ● secondary infiltrates in other organs like lung or liver, where can specifically lead to granulomatous hepatitis.  Therapy: Therapeutic strategies consist in CVC/catheter removal and antibiotics directed specifically against the species isolated (6-12 weeks).  MYCOBACTERIUM CHIMAERA (MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM COMPLEX) M. chimera is included in MAC, but it can be genetically differentiated from Mycobacterium Avium and Mycobacterium Intracellulare. Recently, it’s been shown that disseminated M.chimera infection can be associated with heater-cooler units after cardiac surgery such as aortic valve surgery without endocarditis.   Fig. 26 presents a review where all the cases related to heater-cooler units are reported. It is interesting to note the very long latency, meaning that from surgery to the appearance of symptoms elapsed months or even years (up to 6 or 7 years). While from symptoms to diagnosis elapsed even 1.6 years. This means that it’s not easy to recognise M. chimera as causative agent of infections in patients that have undergone cardiac surgery months or years before. \n Fig. 26  Fig. 27 Clinical manifestation years after surgery includes:  ● Fever (80%), malaise (80%), weight loss (60%), cough (37%), and dyspnea (33%); ● Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and chorioretinitis; ● Cytopenias which is similar to disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients; ● Elevated inflammatory markers, transaminase levels, and creatinine; ● Histopathology is consistent with granulomatous lesions, including dissemination to several organs leading to hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, chorioretinitis, myocarditis, osteomyelitis, and myositis. \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n14 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini   In Fig.27 of a periaortic debris, there is a thick biofilm. It is difficult to diagnose and treat unless tissue is removed. Fig. 28  Laboratory assessment: The gold standard for diagnosis is a M.chimera-positive cultures obtained from an invasive sample (blood, pus, tissue biopsy, or implanted prosthetic material).  Clinical assessment: The diagnosis should moreover include: ● Prosthetic valve endocarditis; ● Prosthetic vascular graft infection; ● Sternotomy wound infection; ● Mediastinitis; ● Bloodstream infection; ● Disseminated infection, including embolic and immunologic manifestations (splenomegaly, arthritis, osteomyelitis, bone marrow involvement with cytopenia, chorioretinitis, lung involvement, hepatitis, nephritis, myocarditis) . Therefore, it is very hard to diagnose it. Exposure assessment: If the past medical history include surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, an infection from M. chimera should be taken into account, either disseminated or affecting a single organ.   TREATMENT OF NTM INFECTIONS The following are some of the principles of treatment. The treatment for NTM is very long: guidelines suggest 12 months from negative cultures, and it might take between from 18 to 24 months. Moreover, all the drugs present significant side effects and poor efficacy rates. The following should be taken into consideration when prescribing medications:  ● ATS criteria for infection versus colonization; ● We should always weigh benefits and potential harms in terms of radiological and clinical microbiological outcome; ● Patients should be involved in the treatment decision and should be informed that the treatment could take 2 years and that there could be side effects.  ● The type of patients must be considered, their lifestyles,their age, their comorbidities. In fact, a 40 years old patient with cystic fibrosis will require a different treatment with respect to a 90 years old woman that just reports asthenia.  There are very few RCT20 guide treatment, therefore, dosage or amount of drugs to be taken and the length of the treatment changes according to the species, severity of the disease and concomitant disorders. Usually the treatment is a combination of macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) plus ethambutol and rifabutin/rifampicin. Thus, is a standard 3 drug regimen, and every species has a different set of drugs. For instance, M. abscessus had a completely different regimen that involves 4 weeks of Intravenous therapy at  20 Randomized clinical trials  \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n15 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  the beginning and then continuous therapy with oral drugs.  Fig. 29 The guidelines of the American Thoracic Society  and the British Thoracic Society represent the best source of knowledge for the clinical management of these infections.21 As shown in figure 20  the outcomes are poor, even using the 3 drugs regimen for MAC- correlated pulmonary disease, 40% of the patients doesn’t survive (32% for all causes while only in 8% deaths is related to mycobacterium),16% risk of relapse and the percentage of 5 years survival is only 27%. Recap: very long treatment, side effects present and poor outcomes.  FAILURE Failure should be distinguished in three fields: ● Clinical failure: patients do not improve, although the microbiological picture improves; ● Microbiological failure with non-sputum conversion: all the selection resistance22 ● Radiological failure: lesions do not improve or even worsen under treatment. Outcomes are set with the patient, if after a year we do not have improvement with this treatment, the outcomes may be weighted again with the patient and he should be involved in the decision regarding his future treatment. The rate of failure and/or relapse: ● MAC-PD presents a failure rate around 13-16% with 3-drug regimen, which is not very high. Up to 48% in some case series, the rate of reinfection is very high, around 75%. Higher incidence if previously treated, macrolide resistance, non-sputum conversion after 6 months. Better outcomes by adding «new» drugs (fluoroquinolones,     clofazimine, linezolid). ● M. Abscessus-PD presents a failure rate of 42% with standard treatment (4 weeks i.v. plus maintenance). Further distinguishing between M. abs. abscessus and M. abs. massiliense, the former present a failure rate of 75%, whereas the latter of 22%. Therefore M. abs. abscessus is the most difficult to treat. Relapse rates are: 24-42% con 1/2 iv drugs 58% in Myc abs abscessus vs. 5% in Myc abs   massiliense. 52% in the US23  INHALED LIPOSOMIAL AMIKACIN There are several trials for new drugs, including those discussed for resistance TB: bedaquiline, clofazimine and lanesolate, tenozalide . The only very specific drug for NTM in development (not already approved by the FDA) and evaluation under EMA is inhaled liposomal amikacin. Amikacin is used for the treatment of NTM, but Intravenous amikacin has the disadvantage that it must be given IV in day hospital. Moreover, it is associated with renal insufficiency that may be irreversible and also with ear toxicity (ototoxicity), leading to several symptoms and correlated with a genetic predisposition. Using inhaled liposomal amikacin renal  21 These guidelines present complete informations on every single species. They are not required to be read for the exam but keep in mind that whenever there’s a doubt on a treatment for a particularly rare species, these are the literature that doctors refer to. 22 Audio at slide 68 (microbiological failure at the time 00:09 min) - Not so clear. 23 Everything in Italic is integrated from the slides \n12.03.2024                                                                                                                                           CALCAGNO L02   \n16 Giulia Nigra, Sara Schiffini  insufficiency is totally avoided, while IR toxicity is only partially avoided. The liposomal formulation increases the amount of drugs that get inside alveolar macrophages (which are the target sites) and decreases the amount of drugs that is systemic available, thus affecting the tolerability of the patient.    TREATMENT OF MACROLIDE-R MAC-PD. We should always ask to the laboratory if our NTM is resistant or susceptible to macrolides. Macrolides are the cornerstone. Moreover, there is a genetic association, meaning that there is a genetic probe that will indicate if the NTM is resistant. It is a slow and complex phenotypic test, therefore only few laboratories are able to perform this phenotypic assessment of NTM susceptibility to drugs.   In case of MAC-pulmonary disease, that is macrolide resistant, in which the efficacy is around 20%, a combination of four drugs is used: rifampicin, ethambutol, ionized FQ/clofazimine and inhaled amikacin.  In case of M. abscessus PD (macrolide resistant) there are few weeks of intravenous treatment and a very long phase of oral drugs, including new drugs. However, there are side effects: linezolid is a very powerful anti-Gram+ drug and is associated with peripheral neuropathy, anemia and thrombocytopenia, so is hard to use it for 2 years. Almost all these drugs have side effects that make it difficult to have a long-term treatment based on them.   MULTIDISCIPLINARY MANAGEMENT  Fig. 30 Usually the pharmalogical treatment is combined with a non pharmacological one as shown in figure 30.  Physical exercise is very important, as well as airway clearance therapy, followed by a pneumologist, in order to open the airways.

In Fig.13 there is a depiction of what might be seen. According to the position of the dots, different scenarios might be recognised. The orange line provides an index of BBB impairment. A high albumin ratio (seen by moving along the orange arrow towards the top-right portion of the graph, ed.) reflects an increased concentration of albumin, which is a big molecule, in the CSF, indicating a leakage through the BBB and therefore an impairment of the barrier. On top of the orange arrow, the purple line represents the production of IgG in the CNS. So, after correcting this value for albumin concentration, the amount of IgGs produced in the CNS - related to those in the periphery - can be checked. It is a measure of intrathecal inflammation, hence it indicates whether there is an ongoing inflammatory process and how many of these immunoglobulins are being produced locally. Overall, it’s very cheap and can help to get an idea of the situation. Subsequent tests define if the IgGs are monoclonal, polyclonal or oligoclonal. Oligoclonal IgGs in the CSF is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a disease characterized by an autoimmune process in the brain.  MENINGITIS Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges and/or of the CSF, i.e. the liquid within the meninges. The onset of meningeal symptoms is usually acute, over a matter of hours or at most a few days. There are also some forms of chronic meningitis in which symptoms appear over a time span of a few weeks or months (usually > 4 weeks), but they are very uncommon.  PRIMARY CLASSIFICATION Meningitis can be divided into bacterial and aseptic.  ● Bacterial meningitis usually presents an unclear purulent CSF, which might appear yellowish or whitish. The CSF contains an elevated number of cells, up to thousands, mostly granulocytes and neutrophils. At the beginning of this process there might be a predominant increase of lymphocytes. Other findings in the CSF include elevated levels of proteins and low glucose concentration18. It’s mainly due to bacteria, whereas other causes (such as Amoeba or Cerebral abscesses) are less common. It is important to remember that since some of these bacteria are transmittable person-to-person, the patient should be isolated.   ● Aseptic meningitis: CSF is clear and colorless, with sometimes “dust-like” particles. The number of cells, usually lympho-monocytes, is elevated but usually to a lower extent compared to bacterial meningitis. Protein concentration is also elevated but again, not as much as for BM. Glucose concentration is normal, because viruses do not use glucose (the same is true for intracellular bacteria). Etiological agents may be viruses, intracellular bacteria (Leptospira, Brucella, Borrelia...), or partially treated bacterial meningitis. In fact, a patient at home with bacterial meningitis who has  18 Glucose concentration is low because it is consumed by the bacteria. \nFig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC 13  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   12 been treated with antibiotics, might present with difficult-to-recognize symptoms and a CSF resembling aseptic meningitis. Always ask patients if they have been taking antibiotics.  The orange line (last row) in Fig.14 represents an exception of aseptic meningitis in which the CSF appears clear, the cell count remains in the same range as before, maybe consisting of lymphomonocytes and neutrophils at the beginning, but there is very high level of proteins and low glucose levels. In this case, the main suspicion is Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; to sum up, TB meningitis has very clear CSF presentation, resembling aseptic meningitis, but glucose is heavily consumed. Fungi could also be a possible cause but a \npretty rare one.   EPIDEMIOLOGY ● Bacterial Meningitis The two most common causes are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis, but it may also be due to Haemophilus influenzae. In general, Bacterial Meningitis is not common, but the situation changes from country to country. In western countries (Finland, Netherlands, and the United States) the incidence is 0.7-0.9 per 100,000 people/year, and over time in the last 30 years the prevalence has reduced thanks to vaccination. In some African countries like Burkina Faso and Malawi the incidence is still very high, 10-40 per 100,000 people/year.   ● Aseptic meningitis: - Predominantly caused by Enteroviruses - In the US 30-75,000 cases/year - Predominance of infection during summer and fall in areas with a temperate climate because people spend more time outdoor, while in areas with tropical climates the infection is present all year round - It’s spread from person-to-person mainly through fecal-oral transmission, although houseflies, wastewater and sewage may contribute to the spread  - It may affect both children and adults  - Risk factors such as rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, have been associated with a higher chance of presenting aseptic meningitis    \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   13 THE “MENINGITIS BELT”   The area in Sub-Saharan Africa was named this way due to the recurrent epidemics that occur every year due to Neisseria meningitidis. They are usually due to non-B serotypes, mostly serogroup A, although after the MenA19 vaccination (2010) C, Y, W135 and X have also been more common20.   There is a higher risk during dry season (December-June); the suspicion is that the dust particles may carry the meningococci leading to a larger spread which may cause several epidemics. Every 5-10 years21 there is a large-scale epidemic in the area. Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia are requested a certification of vaccination in order to the avoid spread.   MENINGITIS VALUES IN ITALY  In 2015 and 2016 there has been a rise in meningitis C cases in Italy, for which Tuscany was the epicenter and actually the only region involved. In Piedmont there were around 10-15 cases every year, but in Tuscany the number of cases was its double in 2015 and triple in 2016. It was mostly due to meningococci C, even in vaccinated patients. It therefore raised questions about its virulence and about the effectiveness of the vaccination.  \n 19 Meningococcal A vaccine  20 From the slides: 1000 per 100k pop 21 In the slides it’s 5-12 years \nFig.  SEQ Fig. \n\\* ARABIC 16  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   14   Fig.17 shows the most recent data from Piedmont. Aseptic meningitis is the most common form, with an incidence of 50-100 cases every year, while the incidence of bacterial meningitis (mostly meningococcal meningitis) is around 10-15 cases every year. In both cases the trend has remained quite stable over the last 7 years. However, in the last years, the incidence has reduced to almost zero, because of mask usage but also because Piedmont started to have vaccination for the Meningococcus B strand.   This (fig.18) is a graph showing the effect of vaccination on the etiology. You can see that overtime, when the \nvaccine was introduced, for example H. influenzae vaccine, N. meningitis vaccine, there has been a steep reduction of the strains. The one that is still present is S. pneumoniae, because the vaccination is reserved for people over 65 and those with chronic lungs problems, and is not that effective. The primary cycle of the vaccine is administered very young, and it protects from pneumonia below the age of five. When people are older they get revaccinated.  From fig. 19, it is possible to see that there is a very strong age determinant. For example, some of these affects only newborns, like S. agalactiae. N. menigitis as well is mostly see in the young ones, below the age of 20. S. pneumoniae is more common below the age of 5 (that’s why we vaccinate children) but then is again present below the age of 65.  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   15  Fig. 19    CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF MENINGITIS  As anticipated, the most common causative agents of meningitis nowadays is Streptococcus pneumoniae22 (45%), followed by Neisseria meningitidis (25%), then by group B Streptococcus23 (15%), Listeria monocytogenes (10%), and a very small number due to Haemophilus influenzae (5%).  Over time, there has been a steep decrease of Neisseria and Haemophilus infections due to the widespread vaccination, and therefore the incidence is actually lower than the values previously mentioned, so although it varies depending on the country, it may even be as low as 0.1cases/100K people/year24. There is a lot of risk factors for the development of meningitis, for example immunodepression and splenectomy, because people without  22 a.k.a. Pneumococcus 23 Recall that the only member of GBS (Group B Streptococci) is Streptococcus agalactiae, as explained by prof. Lembo, ed. 24 From the slides: 0.12-3 cases/100k persons/year \nFig.17  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   16 spleen have a higher risk of capsulated bacterial infection.   ● Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus Pneumoniae is the main cause of meningitis in patients above the age of 20, so it has to be suspected in adults. The most important risk factors are sinusitis and otitis media. Most of the patients have a history of sinusitis or ear pain that has not been treated. This is because the bacteria colonize the sinuses or the ear and after that they can create a contact and get directly into the meninges. Performing a CT scan, it is possible to notice bone involvement and perforation, which allows bacteria to cross and enter into the CNS.   CT scans are essential: first, because they detect the presence of masses. Among the numerous bacteria, there is one able to relocate from the throat to the circulation and then to reach the brain, where it replicates leading to a very high bacterial load, which results in severe clinical manifestations.25 The second reason is that entry points to the brain should be repaired. If a patient has a damaged bone wall, this must be repaired immediately to prevent recurrent meningitis by pneumococci. The professor had a patient who had meningitis from streptococcus seven times, because he had rhino-liquorrhea due to a small damage in the skull bone. They saw the damage with a CT scan and repaired it. Moreover, people who had traumatic damages to their skull, for example after a motorcycle accident, have a higher risk of developing meningitis in their life.  There are other less common risk factors such as pneumonia, alcohol abuse, diabetes, splenectomy, hypogammaglobulinemia, complement deficiency, fracture of the skull base, and rhino-liquorrhea (more due to damage in the bone structure).  Mortality is still quite high, around 18-26%, and in older adults it rises to 30-35%.  ● Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria meningitis is most common in children and young adults (2-20 years of age).  Epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis occur only in 2% of cases, while the remaining 98% of cases are sporadic. There are differences in different strains in terms of virulence. Some deficiencies in humoral immunity or complement (C6 to C9) might explain the difference in vulnerability in different individuals. However, usually the first step consists of a transient nasopharyngeal colonization, which can be observed in 5-10% of the normal population. Then the bacteria might outgrow and give rise to an invasive disease with a mortality of around 10%26 (much lower than Pneumococcus but still quite relevant).  One of the warning/alert signs that should be explained to the children’s mothers is the presence of petechiae, which are usually very relevant in the course of the infection and can be the first step of a fulminant disease, leading to death within few hours after the onset of the petechiae. So, a child with very \n 25 This is my best interpretation of what the professor says in slide 36 (00:47): “First, because it tells you something about (body/bony?) mass. There is a lot of bacteria; there is just one bacterium that was in the throat, gets in the circulation and went to the brain. Here there is a very high bacterial load and for this reason the severity of the disease is very high.”  A better explanation may be found from the article “Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Pneumococcal Meningitis”: The most common route of infection starts by nasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which must avoid mucosal entrapment and evade the host immune system after local activation. During invasive disease, pneumococcal epithelial adhesion is followed by bloodstream invasion and activation of the complement and coagulation systems. The release of inflammatory mediators facilitates pneumococcal crossing of the blood-brain barrier into the brain, where the bacteria multiply freely and trigger activation of circulating antigen-presenting cells and resident microglial cells. The resulting massive inflammation leads to further neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, resulting in the well-known features of bacterial meningitis 26 From the slides: Mortality 3-13% 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   17 high fever, uncommon behavior and petechiae should be taken to the emergency room as soon as possible.   Fig.21 reports a list of all the major infectious (viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, spirochetes, protozoa and helminths, and other infectious syndromes) and non-infectious causes (intracranial tumors and cysts, drugs, \nsystemic illnesses, procedure-related and some miscellaneous causes) of symptoms that are similar to acute meningitis. This gives an idea of the complexity of the differential diagnosis of meningitis.   ASEPTIC MENINGITIS – ETIOLOGY Enteroviruses are a large group of viruses, there is cocksackievirus, echovirus, poliovirus. They are neurotrophic, that is why they can infect the brain. Another important group is the arboviruses. A common question the professor asks to students at the exam is: “when you think about meningitis, when you perform a lumbar puncture and you can see a clear CSF, so an aseptic meningitis, which are the viruses you think first?” and the answer is enteroviruses and arboviruses.   \nFig.  \nSEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n21 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   18 OTHER CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF MENINGITIS Some risk factors of the other causative agents of meningitis are listed in fig.22.  \nFor example, Staphylococcus aureus infection is sometimes observed in hospitalized patients and after neurosurgery. Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae may also be present in patients that have been hospitalized with severe co-morbidities and after neurosurgery. Haemophilus Influenzae Type B is sometimes observed in children, more commonly in the USA than in Europe, but unvaccinated children are more prone to this infection.  Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) is usually observed in elderly but also in newborns, so mothers are screened for the presence of GBS in the vagina.   ● Listeria monocytogenes One important causative agent of meningitis is Listeria monocytogenes, which usually causes an aseptic meningitis27, but sometimes the CSF is not clear. It might be observed in newborns, pregnant women, elderly and immune deficient patients including homeless people, cirrhotic patients, end-stage kidney-diseased patients and alcohol abusers.28 The epidemics in the last years have involved foie gras, watermelons from Australia, and carne mechada from Spain. So, there are different foods that can carry Listeria bacterium, although in the beginning only cheese was thought to be involved, mostly soft cheeses. That is why pregnant women are suggested to not eat them, because listeria infection in pregnancy can be dangerous both for the mother and the fetus.  Listeria infection is therefore a foodborne disease and quite uncommon, affecting 3-6 people/1 million/year in Italy.  A French study conducted by MONALISA29 collected all the cases with a 2 year follow up and reported the different presentations associated with Listeria infection.  27 This is what the professor says. However, several sources on the Internet claim that it’s a bacterial meningitis, not aseptic (e.g. the article “Aseptic and Bacterial Meningitis: Evaluation, Treatment, and Prevention” by H. R. Mount et al.). 28 From the slides: Older age, innate and cellular immune defects, malignances, HIV infection, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and immunosuppressive therapies. 29 “Clinical features and prognostic factors of listeriosis: the MONALISA national prospective cohort study” by Chralier C. et al.

The cases were divided into maternal cases (i.e. during pregnancy), bacteremia (i.e. patients in which Listeria was isolated in blood cultures) and neurolisteriosis (in which there was CNS involvement). As shown, patients with neurolisteriosis were older, with an average age of 67, and they had some comorbidities (around 3 per patient). 97% of patients presented fever, whereas diarrhea and septic shock were not so common. The Glasgow Coma Scale was 12, which is a relevant value. 2/3 of the patients had positive blood cultures for Listeria once the CNS was involved.  In fig.24, the mortality rates recorded by the study are shown. In the graph on the left (A), the red line (lower) indicates bacteremia cases (46%), whereas the green (middle) represents neurological cases (30%). It is possible to see that the mortality in bacterial cases (blue line) is very low, 0%. Mortality was “intermediate” in patients with neurological symptoms. This may be due to the fact that neurological cases allowed a rapid recognition of the problem, while bacteremia was more difficult to recognize because the symptoms were pretty a-specific. However, in graph on the right (B) it can be noticed that the neurological cases that had \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   20 bacteremia (green line in the middle) had a higher mortality rate (40%).  Neurolisteriosis patients receiving adjunctive dexamethasone also displayed an increased mortality.30 For both bacteremia and neurolisteriosis, the strongest mortality predictors/risk factors are: - Ongoing cancer - Multiple Organ Failure - Aggravation/worsening of any preexisting organ dysfunction  - Lymphomonocytopenia31  \nTherapy for listeria is ampicillin, pretty common and can be used for many infections, and all patients above the age of 60 or immunocompromised with a suspicion of listeriosis should receive the antibiotic.             PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  30 From the slides. 31 Lymphomonocytopenia is seen in several infections. The pathogenesis is unknown. It is a prognostic factor in viral pneumonia, such as Covid-19 disease, which will be dealt with later during the course. \n \nFig.  SEQ \nFig. \\* \nARABIC \n24 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   21 ● Bacterial meningitis    Nasopharyngeal colonization is usually the first step. It is then followed by local invasion, often bacteremia, invasion of the meninges, then a process of microvascular invasion starts, with macrophages, neutrophils and other CNS cells releasing cytokines, leading to subarachnoid space inflammation and possibly cerebral vasculitis and cerebral infarction. Remember that most of these infections are associated with secondary vasculitis and vascular problems in the CNS.  In Fig.26, some of the bacterial and host features that might favor each of these steps are depicted. Some of these may favors mucosal colonization, intravascular survival, meningeal invasion or survival in the subarachnoid space – all of these may increase persistence, invasiveness and pathogenicity of this bacteria.                     ● Aseptic meningitis There are different ways for viruses to reach the CNS32.  1. Mucosal colonization involving either the peri-tonsillar lymphatics or Peyer’s patches in the gut, leading then to viremia and finally to the crossing of the BBB by the viral particles 2. Some viruses are carried by leukocytes (e.g. Measles, Mumps, Herpes) 3. Directly enter the CNS by crossing the choroid plexus 4. Olfactory nerves may also be a way of entry (e.g. influenza) 5. Peripheral nerves may also be a route entry into the CNS (e.g. Herpes virus).      CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS   32 This topic will be discussed in more detail when dealing with the pathogenesis of encephalitis. \nFig. 25  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   22 ● Bacterial meningitis  Headache, fever and meningismus33 are the most common symptoms of bacterial meningitis, followed by altered sensorium34. Others signs and symptoms like vomiting, seizures, focal neurological findings and papilledema may vary. ● In neonates, however, the clinical manifestations are different. Meningismus is usually absent, and newborns may present instead temperature instability (hypo- or hyperthermia), listlessness35, high-pitched crying, fretfulness, lethargy, refusal to feed, weak suction, irritability, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, or respiratory distress.  ● In very young children, bulging fontanelle36 may be observed. Neck stiffness, seizures (outside the febrile-convulsion age range), and reduced food intake37 are also typically found in children. ● In adults, fever, nuchal rigidity and altered mental status are seen only in 2/3 of the patients. The classical case is very easy to recognize, but in 1/3 of cases there are uncommon symptoms that might render the diagnosis more difficult. Also, depending on whether patients took antibiotics, there could be the presentation of different or less common signs.   Fig.28 depicts a patient intubated because of a pneumococcal meningitis. Notice how his body is covered by numerous petechiae. The intubation is required in order to protect the airways since the value of the Glasgow Coma Scale is so low that the patient is unable to breathe autonomously.    \n In order to provide clear advice to families, the meningitis glass test may be employed (fig.29). The presence  33 Meningismus = A state of meningeal irritation with symptoms suggesting meningitis.  34 From Wikipedia: A clouded sensorium, also known as an altered sensorium, is a medical condition characterized by the inability to think clearly or concentrate. 35 From Dictionary.com: Listlessness = having or showing little or no interest in anything; languid; spiritless; indifferent: a listless mood. 36 The presence of bulging fontanelle usually worries the mothers. Once, the professor has seen such a big bulging fontanelle that it has very hard and impossible to be pressed back into the skull. The following information was provided by the sbobinatore: A fontanel, also called fontanelle, is more commonly known as a soft spot. When a baby’s born, they typically have several fontanels where bones of their skull haven’t fused yet. A newborn has fontanels on the top, back, and sides of their head. Changes in texture or appearance can be a sign of serious health issues. Parents should watch for soft spots that are curved outward on their baby’s head and feel very firm. This is known as a bulging fontanel and may be a sign of brain swelling or fluid buildup in the brain. A bulging fontanel is an emergency. It can be a sign of pressure rising inside the skull which may result in damage to the baby’s developing brain. 37 From the slides. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   23 of fever with spots/rash/petechiae that do not fade after pressing the side of a clear glass firmly against the skin, indicates a medical emergency.  ● Aseptic Meningitis  ● Neonates usually present fever and gastrointestinal discomfort such as vomiting and anorexia. They may also present a rash and upper respiratory tract symptoms such as cough. Sometimes also nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelle are present. In newborns, outcomes may be very severe when infection occurs early on, i.e. through transplacental transmission, which may lead to Multiple Organ Failure.  ● In children and adults, fever is usually present and it may be biphasic – an acute early fever followed by a later second rise in temperature. 50% of the patients present nuchal rigidity, usually with headache and photophobia38, often accompanied by non-specific symptoms including: ■ pleurodynia39, herpangina40, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease41 caused by Coxsackievirus, which are a subfamily of Enteroviruses ■ scattered maculopapular rash caused by Echovirus 9 ■ pleural and pericardial effusion caused by Coxsackievirus B42 ■ enteroviruses, typically Enterovirus 71, can lead to some severe syndromes in older children (mortality up to 14%).  Fig.30 shows a patient with herpangina, a typical symptom associated with aseptic meningitis. It is one of the oral manifestations of enterovirus infection, and it is characterized by ulcers on the back of the throat which cluster together in the same area. SIGNS OF MENINGITIS  There are several signs that a neurologist should look for in a patient with meningitis. The most important two according to the professor’s opinion are the neck rigidity (Brudzinski sign) and the Kernig sign.  In meningitis, the neck is stiff making the patient unable to bend the neck over the chest, and its passive flexion by the physician causes flexion of both legs and thighs (Brudzinski sign).  The Kernig sign is positive when a patient lying down with the hip flexed at 90° cannot fully extend the knee.  All these signs are signs of inflammation of the meninges and of the spinal nerves, and are due to the involuntary attempt of the patient to reduce the pain caused by these maneuvers. The position of meningitis patients is the lateral position, with the head extended and the eyes closed, and they do not move. This is very typical of meningitis, as every movement is painful. \n 38 Photophobia = extreme sensitivity to light 39 Pleurodynia = severe pain in the muscles between the ribs or in the diaphragm, caused typically by Coxsackie B 40 Herpangina, also called mouth blisters, is a painful mouth infection caused by coxsackieviruses, usually coxsackievirus A 41 Hand, foot, and mouth disease: A common illness of infants and children under 10 years old characterized by fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters due to infection most commonly with coxsackievirus A16 or less often enterovirus 71 or another enterovirus. 42 From the slides: Coxsackievirus A -> herpangina while B -> pleural and pericardial effusion Fig. 30  \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   24  Fig. 31 Another sign of meningitis that has been recently introduced is the jolt accentuation of headache. It is performed by rotating 1-2 times the head of a patient with headache, resulting in a steep accentuation of the pain. The professor doesn’t consider this test to be very specific for meningitis, as no one would be very happy to have their head rotated if they had a headache, which would probably worsen after this maneuver.  DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis is based on the CSF analysis. In bacterial meningitis, gram staining (often positive) and culture exam (positive in 70-90% of the cases) are needed. Bacterial antigens may be obtained quickly (usually within one hour), and even though their sensitivity is not very high (70%), specificity is approximately 100%. PCR is the most sensitive and specific technique both for bacterial and aseptic meningitis.  Bear in mind that stool or throat swabs for enteroviruses have a specificity for 96%, so they might be useful.    There are also some scores that might be helpful. For example, the Bacterial Meningitis Score suggests that \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   25 there is low risk (NPV 99.7%) of bacterial meningitis when:  ● CSF gram stain is negative ● CSF absolute neutrophil count < 1,000 ● CSF protein < 80 mg/dL ● peripheral absolute neutrophil count < 10,000.  Lactate can also be used for the differential diagnosis between bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Elevated CSF lactate concentration suggests bacterial meningitis, for which it shows a sensitivity of 93-97% and a specificity of 94-96%, better than some other CSF parameters.43  FILM ARRAY It is possible to perform multiple PCRs, i.e. PCRs that are carried out at the same time for two different targets. This technique is called film array, and it covers the most important bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus B, Escherichia coli), yeasts like Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii and the most important viruses44 (Enterovirus, Herpes 1 to 6, Human parechovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Cytomegalovirus). The results can be available in 2-6 hours, which can be very helpful in targeting treatment.   COMPLICATIONS  There are many. In the case of bacterial: DIC, sepsis and shock. There are several neurological complications, including cranial nerve palsies, that can be examined by pressing the cranial nerves inducing palsies. Other complications include seizures, focal signs, hydrocephalus. The latter is caused by CSF cannot flow, so the ventricles enlarge and this can induce coma. There are also several sub-acute and chronic complication. A complication very important in children is neurodevelopmental delay.   MANAGEMENT ● Rapid initiation of antimicrobial treatment is fundamental and it’s the first thing to do. It should be initiated within hours even if the lumbar puncture is delayed.45  ● Management of elevated intracranial pressure: it includes procedures like the specific position of the head at 30°, CSF drainage (suggested in certain situations), osmotic dehydration by using 0.25-0.5 g/kg of mannitol (advised in cases of edema or brain masses). Mass removal or decompression may also be necessary, for example in case of a very big brain abscess. Also hypothermia and hyperventilation can be employed to treat ICU46 patients with elevated intracranial pressure.  43 From the slides. 44 Not all the viruses, but the majority of them. 45 Recall the study reported in Fig.9, which suggested that within 2 hours all patients were started on antibiotic treatment. 46 ICU: intensive care unit \nFig.31  \nFig. 34  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   26 ● Management of seizures: seizures should be managed with anticonvulsants, usually after consulting a neurologist. ● Fluid management: administration and replacement of fluids is necessary to maintain a normovolemic state. Fluids may be lost due to sweating in case of fever, tachypnea in case of sepsis, or simply because patients do not eat or hydrate properly. The balance of volemia is important in critical care patients with severe CNS infections.   ANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENT – BACTERIAL MENINGITIS Professor says he usually does not ask this at the exam.  ● Ceftriaxone [2g x 2/day]: The standard treatment for bacterial meningitis is Ceftriaxone at double dose because it has to cross the BBB.47 ● Vancomycin [15-20 mg/Kg x 2/day]: if in the last 6 months the patient has had a recent trip to a country or has been living in a country with penicillin-Resistant-pneumococci, vancomycin is suggested as an additional agent (so, ceftriaxone plus vancomycin).  ● Ampicillin (amoxicillin) [2g x 6/day]: in newborns, patients above the age of 60 and immunocompromised subjects (including diabetics and alcohol abusers), the addition of ampicillin or amoxicillin is suggested in case of Listeria and mostly when the CSF appears clear.  ● Chloramphenicol [25 mg/Kg x 4/day]: in case of a history of severe allergies or anaphylaxis to penicillin and cephalosporins, chloramphenicol may be used instead with or without the addition of Cotrimoxazole [2.5-5 mg/kg x 4/day].    Fig.35 shows in red the countries that are suggested to have a significant prevalence (> 5%) of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Italy48 is one of these nations49. This means that in these areas, in order to protect the patient against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, vancomycin should be administered in addition to ceftriaxone in most of the cases. Then, after the results of the culture and the antibiogram are out, ceftriaxone may be given by itself, without a second antibiotic.   The duration of the antibiotic treatment is indicated as follows: ● S. pneumoniae: treatment should last 10-14 days (14 days if there is a slow recovery or the if the culture reveals a penicillin-resistant strain) ● Neisseria meningitidis: British guidelines suggest 5 days, whereas in Italy treatment usually last 5 to 7 days ● Listeria monocytogenes: the therapy is longer, around 21 days (3 weeks) ● Other bacteria: the duration ranges from 10 days to 3 weeks according to clinical conditions.  47 From the slides: Cefotaxime (2g x 4/day) may also be used 48 “We will see in our discussion that Italy is always red on the maps, so it’s bad” cit. 49 From the slides: The other countries are Canada, China, Croatia, Greece, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Spain, Turkay, and USA. \nFig.32  Fig. 35  04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   27  Other compounds can be used too. In Fig.37, the CPR (CSF to plasma ratio) of the drugs is shown, both in normal conditions (3rd column) or in case of inflamed meninges (4th column), so in the first days of treatment. Most drugs reach very low concentrations (2-5%) with just a few exceptions. Most of the medications reported can be safely used and in some cases the dose may be increased. For instance, Linezolid is one of the oxazolidinone antibiotics used for treating resistant gram-positive infections and it can also be employed effectively against various CNS infections thanks to its good pharmacokinetics in the CSF. \n Fig. 37 In some cases, an intraventricular antibiotic therapy may be employed. It is usually performed in neurosurgery wards after a neurosurgical intervention. In fact, it can be difficult to treat ventriculitis (i.e. infection of the ventriculi) with normal antibiotics, so in some cases the antibiotics are instead directly injected inside the ventricles for a few days in order to increase the amount of drugs reaching the target and to reduce the bacterial load. Afterwards, systemic therapy is continued.   Risk factors for a fatal outcome in meningococcal disease50 There are some risk factors that should be considered when dealing with a patient with meningococcal disease are:51  50 From Wikipedia: Meningococcal disease describes infections caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (also termed meningococcus). 51 In bold are the most important ones. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   28 ● Low or normal peripheral WBC count: it means no response from the immune system ● Low acute phase reactants such as PCR and ESR ● Low platelets: it implies blood vessels involvement ● Coagulopathy: it implies liver involvement ● Absence of meningitis ● Hypotension and shock: the progression of meningococcal sepsis can be very rapid, and in some cases it can progress within few hours into MOF and death ● Rapidly progressing rash ● Coma ● Lactate > 4 mmol/L52  PROPHYLAXIS -   Neisseria meningitidis: it is the only bacterium that can be spread from person-to-person.53 As transmission is mediated by droplets, anyone who has come into close contact (roughly within a 1-meter distance) with an infected patient displaying fever, without protection, is considered to be at risk of infection. This includes family members, doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc. All these people should therefore be treated prophylactically with Ciprofloxacin or Rifampicin.   -   Haemophilus influenzae: despite being uncommon, it is also easily transmissible by close contact, therefore it’s suggested to receive prophylaxis with Rifampicin because of the high degree of colonization and chance of infection.   It is very important to isolate the patient with active meningitis.  \n  CORTICOSTEROIDS A review from the Cochrane library54 reports the updated version of “Corticosteroids for acute bacterial meningitis”. The professor highlighted three sentences in purple and one in yellow (here reported), which  52 From the slides. 53 This is what the professor says, although to me it seems incorrect since many other bacteria causing meningitis have person-to-person transmission, such as S. pneumoniae (from Wikipedia: It spreads by direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by autoinoculation). Maybe he meant that Neisseria meningitidis is the only bacterium responsible for meningococcal meningitis and it is spread from person-to-person, or that the bacterium only infects humans since there is no animal reservoir. 54 “Cochrane reviews are a bit boring to read, I think everyone - well, epidemiologists - just read the main results” cit. \n04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   29 are the main concepts that must remembered55: 1. “There was insufficient evidence that corticosteroids caused a reduction in mortality overall. However, they caused lower rates of severe hearing loss, any hearing loss, and neurological sequelae”. 2. “Corticosteroids reduced mortality in Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis” 3. “Corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss in children with H. Influenzae meningitis, but not in children with meningitis due to non-Haemophilus species” 4. “In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss, any hearing loss and short-term neurological sequelae. There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries” There is evidence suggesting that in children the use of corticosteroids was associated with lower rates of severe hearing loss and neurological sequelae, mainly in cases of Haemophilus influenzae infection. Corticosteroids also reduce mortality in Streptococcus Pneumoniae meningitis and, despite the differences between high- and low-income countries, globally the suggestion is to use short-term corticosteroids for the first days of bacterial meningitis. It is important to administer these drugs as soon as possible, therefore right before giving antibiotics or together with antibiotics.   TREATMENT FOR ENTEROVIRUSES While most cases of aseptic meningitis are mild and last for just a few days with no sequelae, there are also some severe forms in immunocompromised patients and newborns which might benefit from treatment. One of the potential drugs that may be used in these settings is Pleconaril, but it is still under development (phase 3), so it is not available on the market yet.    MOLLARET’S MENINGITIS Mollaret’s meningitis is a syndrome that may be diagnosed simply by listening to the patient’s medical history56. It’s characterized by: -  Repeated episodes of meningitis, typically lasting 2-5 days, occurring weeks to years apart; -  Usually mild symptoms, including headache and photophobia; it may also be associated with disorientation and dizziness; -  Almost 50% of patients over time develop long-term neurological impairment, such as problems with memory, balance, coordination and/or hearing; -  25% of cases are caused by HSV-2 (but also HSV-1 and EBV have been detected in some cases), even in patients without a history of recurrent genital herpes; -  Treatment of acute episodes with acyclovir or valacyclovir, and, potentially, prophylaxis with valacyclovir (1000 mg/day).  Prophylaxis with valacyclovir is effective. The professor followed 2 patients who displayed a decreased number of episodes (only one over 2 years instead of one every 6 months) during the prophylaxis. Therefore, it may provide some benefits although there are no randomized clinical trials to actually support this hypothesis.    CHRONIC MENINGITIS Chronic meningitis is characterized by an indolent onset, a duration > 4 weeks and signs of inflammation in the CSF. Differently from recurrent aseptic meningitis (Mollaret’s syndrome), it does not present with several  55 The complete results are reported on slide 72. 56 Once a patient stopped the professor on the stairs and started telling him his medical history, and after roughly 5 minutes the professor was able to tell him that he had Mollaret's syndrome. 04.04.2024                                                                                                                                                   CALCAGNO L.7   \nGervasio Carolina, Nigra Giulia                                                                                                                                                                   30 acute episodes, instead it develops indolently and chronically over time. It is also different from sequelae.57 In order to make a diagnosis, it is necessary to obtain an accurate history (travel, exposure to animals or foods), perform a neurological examination (which is usually abnormal), carry on with further tests according to the hypothesis and examination, such as skin biopsy, lymph nodes, eye examination, etc., and ask for a brain contrast-enhanced MRI. Sometimes even a brain biopsy has to be employed, giving an idea of how difficult it is to reach the diagnosis.  Fig.39 reports the infectious and non-infectious causes of chronic meningitis. One of them is chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in patients with agammaglobulinemia, a chronic viral meningoencephalitis by enteroviruses. Another possible cause is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, an autoimmune disease associated with choroiditis, chronic iridocyclitis, and alopecia. Some of these conditions are very rare, so a complete workout with the neurologist is necessary to get the diagnosis. [From the slides: In persons who are agammaglobulinemic, a chronic enteroviral meningitis or meningoencephalitis may develop and last several years, often with a fatal outcome; this syndrome has been designated chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in agammaglobulinemia (CEMA) CEMA is a constellation of neurologic symptoms that include headache, seizures, hearing loss, lethargy/coma, weakness, ataxia, paresthesias, and loss of cognitive skills. In about half of these patients, a rheumatologic syndrome, usually dermatomyositis, also develops, probably as a direct result of enteroviral invasion of affected tissues. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is presumably an autoimmune disease consisting of bilateral eye disease, chronic meningitis, and, later in the course, skin findings. Ocular findings are diffuse choroiditis or chronic iridocyclitis. CNS findings include headache, nausea, neck stiffness, tinnitus, and CSF pleocytosis. Alopecia, vitiligo, or poliosis occur later in the disease.]   57 From the slides.", "input": "", "output": "M e n i n g i t i s\n🌡  C l i n i c a l  M a n i f e s t a t i o n s  o f  C N S  I n f e c t i o n s\nThis section f ocuses on the signs and sympt oms of CNS inf ections,  \nemphasizing the dif f er ences bet w een acut e and chr onic pr esent ations and  \nv ar iations b ased on age and c ausativ e agent.\nM e n i n g i t i s :  T h e  C l a s s i c  T r i a d\nF e v er:  A hallmar k of both b act er ial and aseptic meningitis, though absent in  \nsome c ases, p ar ticular l y in neonat es.  Ad v anced Not e:  F e v er's absence  \ndoesn't rule out meningitis, especiall y in immunocompr omised individuals.\nHe adache:  Of t en se v er e and sudden in onset in acut e  \nmeningitis.  Ad v anced Not e:  The charact er of the he adache ( e.g., thr obbing,  \nconst ant) c an of f er clues t o the under l ying c ause.\nAl t er ed Ment al St atus:  R anges fr om subtle confusion t o coma.  Ad v anced  \nNot e:  The specific changes in ment al st atus ( e.g., lethar gy , disor ient ation,  \nhallucinations) c an be indic ativ e of the inf ection's loc ation and se v er it y .\nM e n i n g i s m u s :  S i g n s  o f  M e n i n g e a l  I r r i t a t i o n\nNuchal Rigidit y:  Stif f neck, r esist ance t o p assiv e fle xion.  Ad v anced  \nNot e:  Ma y be absent in neonat es and some adul t s.\nBrudzinski' s Sign:  Passiv e fle xion of the neck elicit s hip and knee  \nfle xion.  Ad v anced Not e:  Sensitivit y and specificit y v ar y .\nK er nig' s Sign:  Inabilit y t o full y e x t end the knee with the hip fle x ed at  \n90° .  Ad v anced Not e:  Similar sensitivit y and specificit y limit ations as  \nBrudzinski's.\nJol t A ccentuation of He adache:  He ad r ot ation w orsens  \nhe adache.  Ad v anced Not e:  Not specific t o meningitis.\nO t h e r  I m p o r t a n t  S y m p t o m s\nSeizur es:  Common in b act er ial meningitis, less so in aseptic.  Ad v anced  \nNot e:  F oc al seizur es suggest loc aliz ed brain in v ol v ement.\nMeningitis\n1V omiting:  F r equent, of t en pr ojectile.  Ad v anced Not e:  Can be a nonspecific  \nsympt om.\nF oc al Neur ologic al Def icit s:  W e akness, p aral ysis, sensor y loss, depending  \non the ar e a of the brain af f ect ed.  Ad v anced Not e:  Indic at es loc aliz ed  \ninf ection or inflammation.\nP apilledema:  Sw elling of the optic disc, a sign of incr e ased intracranial  \npr essur e.  Ad v anced Not e:  De v elops lat er in the course of the dise ase.\nA g e - S p e c i f i c  M a n i f e s t a t i o n s\nNeonat es:  Ma y pr esent with nonspecific sympt oms lik e t emperatur e  \ninst abilit y , poor f eeding, lethar gy , high-pit ched cr y , and bulging  \nf ont anelles.  Ad v anced Not e:  Ear l y -onset neonat al meningitis is of t en  \nse v er e.\nY oung Childr en:  Bulging f ont anelles, seizur es ( out side the f ebr ile  \ncon vulsion age range ), and r educed f ood int ak e ar e common.  Ad v anced  \nNot e:  Meningismus ma y be less pr onounced.\nA dul t s:  The classic tr iad ma y be incomplet e;

The first patient has a history of AML, he received a stem cell transplant and chemotherapy. A few months later, the developed fever and these painful skin lesions (fig. 1). Which questions would you ask this patient?   One student suggested to ask the patient if he was taking immunosuppressors, the professor said that he was. Another student suggested that we should ask the patient if he was taking any new drugs that could’ve caused a reaction, and the professor said it is possible for drugs to give a reaction. Then, another student said we should ask the patient if he has travelled. The professor said this is important, especially if the patient has travelled to tropical countries.   Another student then asked if the patient has been recently hospitalized. The professor said no, but he said that the patient goes frequently to the outpatient hematology ward for check-ups.   Professor said that he would add the question of whether the patient has had contact with animals – domestic animals, wild animals, or any vectors (pigs, mosquitoes, flies) – and whether the patient has been swimming somewhere, kayaking, climbing, going in the woods, so any kind of contact with the outside.   Then the professor asked which test we would request. Someone said a culture of the lesions. In this case, more specifically, a skin biopsy should be requested.  The results showed fungal hyphae invading the blood vessels. These hyphae were described as being septated (walls between cells) with acute angle-branching, with some features being compatible with the fungus Aspergillus.   All bacterial and viral test results were negative. But a fungus few in the blood culture bottle and was visible upon Gram stain. The same fungus also grew from the tissue culture.   Based on phenotypic analysis, this organism was identified as a Fusarium species.  INTRODUCTION  Fungi are eukaryotic microorganisms. They are heterotrophic, which means that they digest their food externally by releasing hydrolytic enzymes into their immediate surroundings. This explains why fungi have the ability to invade blood vessels. There are often sources of hemorrhage on the lesions. And this is because they digest their surroundings.  They are essentially aerobic and can synthesize lysine L-α-adipic acid biosynthetic pathway. Fungi possess chitinous cell walls, plasma membranes containing ergosterol, 80S rRNA, and microtubules composed of tubulin.  \nfig. 1 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         2  Conidia are asexual propagules (reproductive units) formed in various manners. Spores may be either asexual or sexual in origin. CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI – MORPHOLOGY Yeasts are single-celled forms that reproduce by budding.  Molds form multicellular hyphae.  Hyphae can be sparsely septate to regularly septate and possess a variable number of nuclei. In fig. 3 it can be observed how much bigger mold is compared to bacteria.    \n  Dimorphic fungi grow as yeasts or spherules in vivo, as well as in vitro at 37°C, but as molds at 25°C. Dimorphism is regulated by factors such as temperature, CO2 concentration, pH, and the levels of cysteine or other sulfhydryl-containing compounds.  \n \nfig. 2 fig. 3 \nfig. 4 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         3  CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS The classification of fungal infections depends on a few factors. The most important from the point of view of clinical presentation is the site of infection, which can be: superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous or systemic (deep). It can also be classified based on the route of acquisition: either exogenous (airborne, cutaneous, percutaneous) or endogenous (normal flora). For example: candida is present in our body in high amount in the GI tract. It is also present in the mouth, vagina, but in the GI tract it is present in the most significant amount. So, in a situation in which candida passes from the GI tract into the blood circulation, it can cause an infection, the so-called candidemia.  Lastly, it can be classified based on the virulence. Primary pathogens can establish infections in normal hosts, everyone can get an infection by these fungi, whereas opportunistic pathogens cause disease in immune-compromised hosts.  In fig. 5, it is possible to observe the classification of the non-invasive fungi.   \n   And in fig. 6 the invasive pathogens are also included. The systemic ones can spread to locations other than the organs where they started.  The ones in bold are the ones that we have already talked about during the course.  \n \nfig. 5 \nfig. 6 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         4  PITYRIASIS VERSICOLOR  Replication on the skin. It is more common in people after summer, once they have been exposed to sun. It is very easy to treat, we usually use topical antifungal agents.  \n   DERMATOPHYTES The professor didn’t explain the different types of dermatophytes. He just read the names written on the images (fig. 8). Usually, topical treatment is enough to deal with these skin manifestations. \n   CANDIDIASIS OF THE SKIN – INTERTRIGO  Intertrigo is also very common, especially in hospitalized patients and diabetic patients. Very often it is caused by endogenous fungi, such as candida, which can cause these sub-mammary or inguinal lesions (fig. 9).  \nfig. 7 \nfig. 8 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         5   MYCETOMA OR “MADURA FOOT”  This is a very specific one. Not very common in Italy, but it is common in certain tropical countries. It is usually acquired by walking barefoot in soil. We can observe the formation of chronic hypertrophic lesions on the foot, which gets very big. Although the disease usually affects the foot, any part of the body can also be affected. The treatment is a combination of surgery and antifungal drugs.   \nfig. 10  ENDEMIC MYCOSIS There are fungal infections that are seen very specifically in certain areas of the world (fig. 11). There are no cases of these diseases in Europe, it is more common in parts of Africa, Asia and America. Out of these diseases, histoplasmosis is very important. Histoplasma is the main fungi affecting the African continent, as well as parts of South America and the United States. Remember that travel history of the patient is very important because it might indicate different fungi.   \nfig. 9 \n L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         6    HISTOPLASMOSIS  It is common in the Midwestern and Central United States, along the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.  Histoplasma capsulatum proliferates best in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings due to the content of nitrate and pH, which becomes the perfect environment for the fungus.  People who are infected are usually those in contact with chicken coops or farm buildings with large accumulations of bird droppings, abandoned buildings, bird roost sites, caves, and wood lots.  There is a list of activities that makes people more likely to get in contact with the fungus, such as: excavation, construction, demolition, remodeling, wood cutting and gathering, exploring caves, and cleaning structures that are encrusted with bird or bat guano.  HISTOPLASMOSIS – CLINICAL PRESENTATION  Most people are asymptomatic. And most of those with symptoms mostly present with pulmonary histoplasmosis because inhalation is the most common pathway entry. The biggest problem for us is the histoplasma lesions in radiology (fig. 14) is exactly the same as tuberculosis, so the clinical presentation is cough, fever, weight loss, etc. Sometimes we treat patients for tuberculosis and the patient doesn’t respond to treatment. So, we should think of histoplasma.     \nfig. 11 fig. 12 \nfig. 14 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         7  I have seen a case in Uganda in which histoplasmosis presented with these skin lesions (fig. 15) and lung lesions on a young woman who had HIV. She was tested for TB, and in the end the culture of one of her lesions came back positive for histoplasma. She had both TB and histoplasma at the same time.   \n  Let’s proceed by talking about fungi that we actually see in Europe.  ASPERGILLOSIS  Aspergillosis is an umbrella term that covers all illnesses due to due to allergy, airway or lung invasion, cutaneous infection or dissemination by species of Aspergillus.  Most of the cases, around 70% are caused by A. fumigatus, but it can also be caused by A. flavus, niger, terreus. Inhalation of conidia is common (lungs or sinuses) while tissue invasion is rare.  The important thing about Aspergillosis is that microbial factors are able to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis and T-cell response, then they proliferate, leading to vascular invasion and eventually to infarction and tissue necrosis. It is similar to tuberculosis, but weaker.  ASPERGILLOSIS – RISK FACTORS There are several risk factors. It is important to remember severe and prolonged neutropenia (neutropenia stages: from 1000 mcL to 500 mcL is mild; from 500 mcL to 200 mcL is moderate; from 200 mcL to 100 mcL is severe; below 100 mcL is extreme neutropenia). We often see this in hematological patients, in cancer patients as a reaction to chemotherapy.  Administration of high doses of corticosteroids is also a risk factor. Besides that, immunodepression is a risk factor, including chronic granulomatous disease, hematopoietic cell transplant, AIDS. And some drugs are also considered risk factors: ibrutinib and venetoclax.  But there are cases of aspergillosis without severe immunosuppression, just moderate or no immunosuppression at all, such as:  • In COPD patients → they have two risk factors: obstruction of the airways and the administration of corticosteroids, which is a treatment for COPD.  • ICU admission  • Viral infections (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV) → they impair the airways and contribute to the proliferation of Aspergillus  • High exposure (e.g. construction sites workers)  \nfig. 13 \nfig. 15 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         8  ASPERGILLOSIS – CLINICAL PRESENTATION  I want you to remember rhinosinusitis, so chronic rhinosinusitis can be fungal in origin. There is, in very immunosuppressed patients, CNS infections (ring enhancing lesions, cortical and subcortical infarction and dissemination from sinuses). Infarction is very important to be remembered because as mentioned before, Aspergillus cause vascular invasion which leads to infarction.   The professor didn’t mention everything written on the slides, so I attached a picture containing everything (fig. 16).  \n PULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS Most important form. I will show you a picture of an aspergilloma (fig. 17). There is a cavity, and some other radiological features are: single or multiple nodules, patchy or segmental consolidation and peribronchial infiltrates.   \n  \nfig. 16 \nfig. 17 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         9  Some signs and symptoms of pulmonary aspergillosis are: fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and hemoptysis.  There is a form of Aspergillosis called Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA), mostly seen in patients with asthma, which is characterized by wheezing, dyspnea, worsening of asthma symptoms, productive cough with brown mucus or mucus plugs, hemoptysis, anorexia, fever and malaise.  It is usually diagnosed based on the IgE levels.  ASPERGILLOSIS – DIAGNOSIS  The definitive criteria of diagnosis are culture + the presence of hyphae in biopsies. But we might also start by doing a sputum and BAL staining and culture (GAM and/or PCR on BAL). Imaging examinations include X-ray and CT scan.  Another option are serum biomarkers (Galactomannan, 1,3-Beta-D-Glucan) and PCR.  ASPERGILLOSIS – TREATMENT  The professor said he didn’t want to go through treatment because it is too much.  According to the slides, the available treatments are: voriconazole (or posaconazole or isavuconazole when voriconazole is not tolerated) added to ecchinocandins in severe forms; amphotericin-B if azole-R >10% or DDIs/intolerance to azoles; and decrease immune-suppression if possible.  CANDIDA We have talked about candida in the lecture about STI, even though it is not an STI. We have talked about candida in the mouth, in the esophagus, etc.  The three major presentations are:  1. Local mucocutaneous infections 2. Disseminated infections in neutropenic hosts/ICU/AIDS patients 3. Invasive focal infections after candidemia or when abnormalities or devices are present (prosthetic heart valves, CNS shunts…) Today we are going to be focusing on candidemia, which is very common because candida is on the skin. Even immunocompetent hosts can develop candidemia.   Question: Is candidemia common because it is asymptomatic or is it common because it is present on the skin?  Answer: Usually, candidemia itself can be completely asymptomatic or you can have complications. Most often candida is found due to blood cultures.   In fig. 18 you can observe the six most clinically relevant Candida species. The most important is Candida albicans, which is the one that is related to infections. But currently a very important type of candida is Candida auris, endemic in Europe and it is very resistant.   L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         10      There are some regional differences (fig. 19). And those in red are reports of Candida auris in the world.  \n  The local mucocutaneous types of candida infection are:  1. Oropharyngeal \nfig. 18 \nfig. 19 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         11  2. Esophagitis 3. Vulvovaginitis  4. Balanitis 5. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis → common in children, which have repeated skin or nail infections, and it is common in the setting of autoimmune syndromes 6. Mastitis  INVASIVE CANDIDIASIS It always starts with candidemia. The one exception is peritonitis. But all the others (kidneys, lungs, liver) are usually related to candidemia.   Now the first line of treatment for candidemia is (I couldn’t understand what he said so I wrote what I found according to my research online) echinocandin, like caspofungin and anidulafungin.         INVASIVE CANDIDA INFECTIONS – RISK FACTORS 1. Over proliferation of Candida → in skin or mucosal flora, with documented culture-based colonization at multiple body sites, can be risk factors when the following medical interventions are performed:  o Broad-spectrum antibiotics use  o Long-term stay in an acute-care facility or ICU o Mechanical ventilation   2. Breaches in skin or mucosal barriers, either related to an underlying condition or iatrogenic: a. Extensive burns  b. Gastrointestinal perforation  c. Acute or necrotizing pancreatitis  d. Gastrointestinal surgery  e. Chemotherapy-induced mucositis  f. Indwelling intravascular catheters  g. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis  h. Total parenteral nutrition  \nfig. 20 \nfig. 21 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         12  i. Indwelling prosthetic materials, including left ventricular assist devices, ventriculo-peritoneal shunts or external ventricular drains  j. Intravenous drug use  k. Urinary tract instrumentation   3. Intrinsic or acquired immunosuppression a. Genetic susceptibility to invasive candidiasis by variations in immune-related genes  b. Extremes of age (in particular, small, vulnerable newborns)  c. Diabetes mellitus  d. Viral infections such as COVID-19  e. Profound and prolonged neutropenia  f. Solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients  g. Immunosuppressive treatment, including corticosteroids  h. Graft-versus-host disease  DIAGNOSIS OF CANDIDA INFECTIONS  Once again, he did not say anything about diagnosis during the lecture, so I added the image present on the slides.  \n CANDIDEMIA First of all, if candida is present in the blood culture, it is NEVER a contaminant. But if you see candida in the urine, mucus or in the sputum, it most likely a contaminant; therefore, we do not treat candiduria, for example. But if it’s in the blood it is an infection, a severe infection, which means it requires treatment and source control: • Caspo/anidulafungin for 2 weeks after first negative blood culture (repeated every day or every other day until negative) o In neutropenic patients, neutropenia also should be resolved for stopping antifungal therapy • Negative eye fundus examination (2-20%) and cardiac ultrasound → for source control • CVC removal (or individualized management in neutropenic patients) → also source control  Candidemia presents with minimal fever to full-blown sepsis. In case of invasive candidiasis, it may affect the eye, kidney, heart and CNS.  \nfig. 22 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         13   Disseminated candidiasis might present skin manifestations, such as in fig.23.  \n   ZYGOMYCOSIS (MUCORRMYCOSIS)  Then, just to finish I would like to spend one slide talking about mucormycosis (or zygomycoosis). It is caused by a family of fungi called Mucorales, and includes: Rhizopus, Cunninghamella, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Saksenea, and Absidia.  The hyphae are broad, it has 5-15 micon diameter, and it is irregularly branches with rare septations (fig 24).  The risk factors for this disease are:  • Diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis!) • Treatment with glucocorticoids • Hematologic malignancies • Hematopoietic cell transplantation • Malnutrition • Trauma/burns • Solid organ transplantation • Treatment with deferoxamine • Iron overload • Recent COVID-19 • AIDS • Injection drug use They are very important because they can cause a lot of damage: rhino-orbital cerebral (the most severe, from the sinus it spreads to the eyes and to the brain), pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, renal, isolated CNS, disseminated.  Fig. 25 shows the rhino-orbital cerebral condition, in which from the sinus it also spread down to the oral cavity. The treatment requires a combination of medical therapy and surgery to remove all of this tissue of fungal infection.   DIAGNOSIS We have already talked about it:  • Gram stain → fungi are Gram positive. • Histopathology o Superficial infection – acute, subacute or chronic dermatitis with folliculitis \nfig. 23 \nfig. 24 \nfig. 25 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         14  o Subcutaneous & systemic infections – granulomatous reaction with fibrosis or pyogenic inflammation o Routine stain – Hematoxylin & Eosin (HE) o Special stains – PAS (Per Iodic acid), GMS (Grocott Gomori Methanamine Silver), Mayer’s mucicarmine, Gridley’s stain • Fluorescent- antibody staining o To detect fungal Ag in clinical specimen such as pus, blood, CSF, tissue sections o Adv – can detect fungus even when few organisms are present • Fungal Culture o Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) → Contains 2% dextrose, antibiotics (gentamicin, chloramphenicol) and cycloheximide o Selective media ▪ Corn meal agar (CMA) – sporulation, chlamydospore formation ▪ Bird seed agar – cryptococcus, forms brown colonies ▪ Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar – dimorphic & other fastidious fungi • Non-culture-based markers (the most important according to the professor) → focus on galactomannan and beta-glucan o In fig. 26, we can see the cell wall of different fungi.    \n o Galactomannan is only in Asprgillus, it is a very specific test.  o 1, 3-β-D-Glucan (βDG) is common to all fungi, but Mucor (couldn’t understand clearly if this is what he said).   \nfig. 26 L17 CALCAGNO 22.05.2024 \nBeatriz Vitorino, Sara Oderda                                                                                         15    Remember that some antibiotics are produced in fungal cultures, so there are pieces of fungi in certain antibiotics, such as beta-lactams. If the patient is taking such antibiotics, it could lead to false positive results for Galactomannan.   False positive results might also occur in βDG if the patient is in haemodialysis. TREATMENT The Professor finishes the lecture by showing a slide of antifungal drugs. He says he usually doesn’t ask for treatment in the exam, but I have added the table of antifungals (fig. 28) to the SBOBINA for the sake of completeness.   \n  There are 3 types of fungi that are very important when we are talking about drug resistance: Candida auris, azole-rsistant Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton indotineae.  \nfig. 27 \nfig. 28", "input": "", "output": "- fungi >>>\n    - eukaryotic, heterotrophic microorganisms\n    - digest food externally using hydrolytic enzymes - explains ability to invade blood vessels, often causing hemorrhage \n    - primarily aerobic\n    - synthesize lysine\n    - plasma membranes contain ergosterol\n    - reproductive units: conidia (asexual) & spores (can have asexual or sexual origin)\n- yeasts VS molds >>>\n    - yeasts ‒ single-celled fungi reproducing by budding\n    - molds ‒ multicellular fungi forming hyphae (filaments)\n    - dimorphic fungi ‒ exhibit both yeast & mold forms, depending on environmental conditions (T, CO2, pH) - grow as yeast or spherules in vivo or at 37ºC in vitro, and as molds at 25ºC\n    - classification based on morphology is crucial for identification & understanding the potential severity of infection\n- \n- classification of fungal infections, based on >>>\n    - site of infection:\n        - superficial\n        - cutaneous\n        - subcutaneous\n        - systemic\n    - route of acquisition:\n        - exogenous (airborne, cutaneous, percutaneous)\n        - endogenous (from normal flora (e.g. candida in GI) - particularly common in immunocompromised\n    - virulence:\n        - primary pathogens infect healthy individuals\n        - opportunistic pathogens infect immunocompromised hosts\n- \n- \n- diagnosis of fungal infections - depend on: >>>\n    - clinical presentation:\n        - symptoms vary depending on fungus & site of infection\n        - thorough history, traveling history & underlying medical conditions - taken into consideration\n    - miroscopic examination:\n        - examination of specimens - tissue biopsies - to identify fungal elements (hyphae, yeast)\n        - gram staining for initial assessment\n    - culture:\n        - the GOLD STANDARD\n        - on selective media\n        - for definitive diagnosis - but can be time-consuming\n    - serological tests:\n        - detection of fungal Ag & Ab in serum\n        - for rapid diagnosis, but limitation in sensitivity & specificity\n    - molecular diagnostics:\n        - PCR-based methods for rapid & sensitive fungal DNA detection\n- \n- \n- Antifungal Treatment >>>\n    - treatment choices depend on fungus, site of infection & host factors\n    - Major classes:\n        - Azoles: inhibit ergosterol synthesis (e.g. fluconazole)\n        - echinocandins: inhibit cell wall synthesis\n        - polyenes: bind to ergosterol, disrupting membrane integrity (e.g. amphotericin B)\n    - Drug resistance:\n        - Candida auris & azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus - significant concerns due to resistance to commonly used antifungals\n- \n- specific fungal infections >>>\n    - Candida Infections\n    - Aspergillus Infections\n    - murcomycosis (zygomycosis)\n    - Histoplasmosi\n- \n- \n- Candida Infections >>>\n    - candidemia - requires prompt treatment with echinocandins or amphotericin B\n        - source control is crucial\n    - invasive candidiasis - can affect multiple organs (kidney, liver, lungs, CNS)\n        - RF: neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, indwelling devices\n    - mucocutaneous candidiasis ‒ oral thrush, esophagitis, vulvovaginitis\n- \n- Aspergillus Infections >>>\n    - Invasive Aspergillosis\n        - severe infection - esp. in immunocompromised\n        - RF: neutropenia, corticosteroids & hematopoietic stem cell transplant\n        - treatment: azoles, often combined with echinocandins\n    - Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)\n        - Hypersensitivity reaction in patients with asthma\n        - characterized by elevated IgE levels, eosinophilia\n- \n- Mucormycosis (zygomycosis) >>>\n    - caused by Mucorales\n    - characterized by ribbon-like hyphae with septations\n    - RF: diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis), glucocorticoid use, hematologic malignancies\n    - often presents with rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement - requiring surgical debridement & antifungal therapy (amphotericin B, azoles)\n        - so involves sinuses, eyes, & brain\n- \n- Histoplasmosis >>>\n    - caused by Histoplasma capsulatum - found in soil contaminated w/ bird or bat droppings\n    - most infections are asymptomatic or mild - severe disease can involve lungs or disseminate to other organs\n    - treatment depends on severity ‒ may involve azoles, or amphotericin B\n- \n-"}

It can be classified according to the duration of illness as acute (lasting days or weeks) or chronic (lasting months or years). In cases of osteomyelitis, sequestra (pieces of necrotic bone that separate from viable bone) are usually present. This condition is a consequence of bone ischemia and necrosis from blood vessel compression, often associated with bone marrow inflammation. A sinus tract may be present, which is pathognomonic for osteomyelitis. In osteomyelitis, the infection can spread to the periosteum, leading to periosteal seeding of the infection. The infection can also involve the metaphyseal vessels beneath the periosteum, leading to the formation of an abscess. Within the abscess, sequestra (pieces of necrotic bone) may form. Sinus formation can occur in osteomyelitis, leading to the formation of passages called cloacae. These cloacae can discharge pus and bone fragments. Involucrum refers to the new bone formation around the area of infection as a response to the infection.  \nFig.1 Osteomyelitis can be classified according to the source of infection: ● Haematogenous osteomyelitis: This type of osteomyelitis occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream (bacteremia) and spread to the bone, causing an infection. ● Non-haematogenous osteomyelitis: This type of osteomyelitis involves the contiguous spread of infection from surrounding soft tissues or joints to the bone, or through direct inoculation of bacteria into the bone.  Epidemiology and Risk Factors Non-hematogenous osteomyelitis:  - Younger adults are more commonly affected due to trauma and related surgeries.  - Older adults may develop osteomyelitis through spread from soft tissues and joints, such as diabetic foot wounds or decubitus ulcers. \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz  - Risk factors include poorly healing soft tissue wounds (including decubitus ulcers), presence of orthopedic hardware, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and peripheral neuropathy.  Hematogenous osteomyelitis:  - More common in children, while vertebral osteomyelitis is more common in adults.  - Risk factors include age 50 years and older, intravenous drug use (age under 40), endocarditis, indwelling intravascular devices (such as leg or vascular catheters, cardiovascular devices), orthopedic hardware, hemodialysis, and sickle cell disease.  Microbiology Non-hematogenous osteomyelitis  - Involves either polymicrobial or monomicrobial infections  -Most common pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli  - Rare pathogens may include corynebacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria  Hematogenous osteomyelitis:  - Usually monomicrobial   - Most common pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus (potentially multifocal) and aerobic gram-negative bacilli (30%) - Less common pathogens may include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens in intravenous drug users, Aspergillus in immunocompromised hosts, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida species. Clinical Presentation of Osteomyelitis ● Non-hematogenous osteomyelitis:  - Acute presentation: gradual onset of dull pain, may have local findings such as tenderness, warmth, erythema, and swelling, and systemic symptoms like fever. In some cases, especially in the hip, vertebrae, or pelvis, there may be few signs or symptoms.  - Chronic presentation: pain, which may be intermittent, erythema, swelling, and the presence of a draining sinus tract. Fever is usually absent. Deep or extensive ulcers that fail to heal after several weeks of appropriate care, particularly overlying bony prominences, or non-healing fractures. Patients with diabetes may present with atypical findings.  ● Hematogenous osteomyelitis - Clinical presentation may vary but often includes symptoms similar to non-hematogenous osteomyelitis, such as pain, swelling, erythema, and systemic signs of infection.   21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz Specific Forms of Hematogenous Osteomyelitis 1. Vertebral Osteomyelitis: Infection of the vertebrae, which can lead to back pain, spinal deformities, and neurological symptoms if the infection affects the spinal cord or nerves.  2. Sternoclavicular and Pelvic Osteomyelitis: Sternoclavicular osteomyelitis involves infection of the sternum and clavicle bones, while pelvic osteomyelitis involves the infection of the pelvic bones. These forms of osteomyelitis are not uncommon in intravenous drug users (IVDUs) due to the risk of bacteremia from contaminated needles. 3.Long bone osteomyelitis : very rare and more commonly seen in children that in adults. Typically involves the infection of the bone marrow in long bones. \nFig. 2. Professor just read the table    Diagnosis of Osteomyelitis: ● Non-hematogenous osteomyelitis: - Laboratory findings are often nonspecific. - In acute cases, high white blood cell count (WBC) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels may be observed. - In chronic cases, WBC count may be normal, and ESR/CRP levels may be normal or elevated. - Diagnosing osteomyelitis can be challenging in cases involving prosthetic material, extensive skin or soft tissue ulceration, or ischemic changes due to vascular insufficiency. ● Hematogenous osteomyelitis: - Hemocultures may be negative in cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis, particularly if there is clearance of bacteremia by the time of diagnosis. This can make the diagnosis more challenging, as blood cultures may not always yield positive results. \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz   1. History and Physical Examination: - Consider predisposing factors such as trauma, surgery, or underlying conditions. - Perform a thorough physical examination looking for signs of infection, such as localized pain, tenderness, erythema, warmth, and swelling. 2. Blood Tests: - Blood tests may include complete blood count (CBC) to check for elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and inflammatory markers like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). 3. Imaging: - If symptoms have been present for less than two weeks, consider imaging with CT or MRI. - For symptoms lasting longer than two weeks, X-rays may be sufficient for initial evaluation. - For diabetic foot infections, MRI may be the imaging modality of choice. - In cases involving metal hardware, nuclear imaging techniques may be used. 4. Hemocultures: - Blood cultures may help identify the causative organism, especially in cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis. 5. Bone Biopsy: - In some cases, a bone biopsy (open or percutaneous) may be necessary for definitive diagnosis. This procedure can provide samples for gram staining, culture, and histological examination. - Bone biopsy may not be necessary if radiological findings and blood cultures are conclusive for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. \n                                Fig.3 It is important to note that cultures obtained from swabs, sinus tracts, tissue aspirates, or superficial wound biopsies should generally not be used for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. These samples may not provide accurate results for identifying the causative organism in bone infections. For accurate diagnosis and identification of the pathogen causing \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz osteomyelitis, bone biopsy samples (open or percutaneous) are preferred. These samples provide direct access to the infected bone tissue, allowing for more reliable culture and sensitivity testing. Additionally, blood cultures can be beneficial for detecting bacteremia associated with hematogenous osteomyelitis. While swabs, sinus tract cultures, tissue aspirates, or superficial wound biopsies may be useful in other types of infections, they are not typically recommended for diagnosing osteomyelitis due to the risk of false-negative results and the potential for contamination from surrounding tissues  Antibiotic Treatment after Surgery for Osteomyelitis ● Non-hematogenous Osteomyelitis  - In cases where residual infected bone is present or hardware retention is necessary, a prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy is often required.  - Following surgery, intravenous or highly bioavailable oral antibiotic therapy is initiated and guided by antimicrobial susceptibility data for the specific pathogen involved. This treatment typically lasts for over 6 weeks.  - After the initial treatment period, a switch to antibiotic suppression therapy may be considered until fracture union is achieved or no residual infected bone is detected. This may involve a lower dose of antibiotics to prevent recurrence.  - If there is no residual infected bone or soft tissue involvement, amputation or complete hardware removal may be considered.  - In cases where hardware removal is indicated, a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy (typically 5 days, but may be extended to 10-14 days in the presence of extensive soft tissue involvement) is often prescribed, guided by antimicrobial susceptibility data.   ● Hematogenous osteomyelitis In cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis, the duration of antibiotic treatment can vary based on several factors, including the presence or absence of surgical debridement. There is some uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for hematogenous osteomyelitis . 1. If no surgical debridement is performed - Antibiotic therapy may be prescribed for a duration of approximately 4 weeks.  - The decision to initiate antibiotic therapy without surgical debridement may be based on factors such as the patient's clinical condition, imaging findings, and the presence of systemic symptoms of infection.  2. If surgical debridement is performed:  - The duration of antibiotic therapy may start from the time of surgical debridement. 21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz  - In cases where surgical debridement is performed to remove infected tissue and bone, the antibiotic therapy may be initiated post-surgery and continued for a duration as determined by the healthcare provider based on the specific circumstances of the infection.  Spondilodyscitis Spondylodiscitis, also known as vertebral osteomyelitis or spondylitis, is an infection that affects the intervertebral disc space and typically involves two or more adjacent vertebral bodies. This condition can lead to inflammation and destruction of the intervertebral discs and adjacent vertebral bones.  Radiological Classification ● Discitis: Refers to inflammation and infection of the intervertebral disc itself. ● Spondylodiscitis: Involves infection of both the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral bodies, leading to disc and vertebral involvement. ● Vertebral Osteomyelitis or Spondylitis: Indicates infection and inflammation of the vertebral bodies themselves, which may extend from the disc space. Epidemiology It is more common in adults, with most cases occurring in patients over the age of 50. The incidence of spondylodiscitis increases with age, which is likely due to factors such as decreased immune function and the presence of other comorbidities. Men are affected approximately twice as often as women, although the reasons for this gender difference are not fully understood. Spondylodiscitis can also occur in children, although it is less common than in adults. The overall incidence of spondylodiscitis has been increasing in recent years in countries such as the US and France, with rates ranging from 5 to 11 cases per 100,000 person-years. There are several factors contributing to the increasing incidence of spondylodiscitis, including the rising rates of bacteremia due to the use of intravascular devices and other forms of instrumentation in healthcare settings. The aging population, increasing number of patients on dialysis, and the growing use of immunosuppressive medications also play a role in the increasing incidence of spondylodiscitis. Pathogenesis – routes of infection The pathogenesis of spondylodiscitis involves several routes of infection: 1. Hematogenous spread: In many cases, the infection reaches the spine through the bloodstream from a distant site or focus of infection in the body. Common sources of hematogenous spread include urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections (such as those seen in intravenous drug users), respiratory tract infections, infections related to intravascular devices, wound infections, infective endocarditis, dental infections, and direct spread from other abscesses or infected lesions. 2. Direct inoculation: Spondylodiscitis can also occur through direct inoculation of infectious agents into the spine. This can happen as a result of trauma to the spine, invasive spinal diagnostic procedures (such as lumbar punctures, myelography, or discography), spinal surgeries, or other interventions involving the spine (such as translumbar aortography, 21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz chemonucleolysis, facet joint injections, epidural catheter placement, or epidural corticosteroid injections). 3. Contiguous spread: In some cases, the infection can spread to the spine from adjacent soft tissue infections. For example, infections in the soft tissues surrounding the spine can extend into the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, leading to spondylodiscitis. Pathogenesis – extension of infection 1. Posterior extension: ● Epidural abscess ● Subdural abscess ● Meningitis: Infections can spread to the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, leading to inflammation and infection. 2. Anterior or lateral extension: ● Paravertebral abscess  ● Retropharyngeal abscess ● Mediastinal abscess ● Subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscesses ● Psoas abscess: An abscess can develop in the psoas muscle, which is located in the lower back and can cause pain and difficulty moving. 3. Thoracic vertebral infections: ● Thoracic vertebral infections can extend into the pleural space, potentially leading to the development of an empyema (collection of pus) in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs. \nFig. 4 Pathogenesis-risk factors Risk factors for spondylodiscitis include: 1. Injection drug use: Intravenous drug use can introduce infectious agents into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of hematogenous spread of the infection to the spine. 2. Infective endocarditis: Patients with infective endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves, are at increased risk of developing spondylodiscitis. In a retrospective study, approximately 31% of patients with spondylodiscitis were found to have infective endocarditis. \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz 3. Degenerative spine disease: Conditions such as degenerative disc disease or osteoarthritis of the spine can weaken the spinal structures, making them more susceptible to infection. 4. Prior spinal surgery: Previous spinal surgeries can disrupt the normal anatomy of the spine and increase the risk of infection. 5. Diabetes mellitus: Diabetes weakens the immune system and impairs the body's ability to fight off infections, making individuals with diabetes more susceptible to spondylodiscitis. 6. Corticosteroid therapy: Long-term use of corticosteroids can suppress the immune system, increasing the risk of infections, including spondylodiscitis. 7. Immunocompromised state: Patients with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, or those on immunosuppressive medications, have a higher risk of developing spondylodiscitis due to their compromised ability to fight off infections. Aetiology The etiology of spondylodiscitis involves various pathogens, with the majority of cases being caused by a single microorganism. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen responsible for spondylodiscitis, followed by MRSA, which is increasingly prevalent in both community and healthcare settings. Other causative organisms include enteric Gram-negative bacilli, streptococci (both pyogenic and non-pyogenic species), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Candida. In some cases, spondylodiscitis can be caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria, Brucella melitensis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Salmonella species, and Entamoeba histolytica.  Clinical presentation  The clinical presentation of spondylodiscitis typically includes localized pain in the infected disc space area that worsens with physical activity or percussion. The pain may radiate to other areas such as the abdomen, leg, scrotum, groin, or perineum. Symptoms often have a subacute onset with progressive worsening over time, with an average duration of symptoms before diagnosis being around 48 days. Pain may be more severe at night, even after initially improving. Patients may experience reduced mobility and spasms of the paravertebral muscles. In cases where an epidural abscess is present, symptoms can include severe back pain, radiculopathy, motor weakness, sensory changes (such as loss of bowel and bladder control and loss of perineal sensation), and potential paralysis. Fever is not always present but can be seen in a significant proportion of cases. Local tenderness to gentle spinal percussion is a common clinical sign, although it is not specific. In some instances, cold tender masses in the back, known as \"cold abscesses,\" may be present, particularly in infections caused by tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Sources of hematogenous spread leading to spondylodiscitis can include infections from various sites such as the urinary tract, skin and soft tissue, respiratory tract, intravascular devices, wounds, infective endocarditis, dental infections, or direct spread from other abscesses or infected lesions Diagnosis 21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis involves a comprehensive approach, starting with a detailed history and physical examination to assess symptoms, risk factors, and clinical findings. Laboratory tests, including ESR, CRP, and blood and urine cultures, are performed to evaluate inflammation markers and identify potential pathogens. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, are used to visualize the affected area and confirm the diagnosis. Obtaining samples for culture through CT-guided needle biopsy or pus aspiration helps in identifying the causative pathogen, guiding targeted antibiotic therapy. In cases where initial cultures are negative but suspicion remains high, a second biopsy may be considered for a definitive microbiological diagnosis. Surgical consultation is recommended for patients with neurologic deficits, epidural or paravertebral abscesses, or signs of cord compression, as they may require surgical intervention. Understanding the diagnostic process for spondylodiscitis is essential for accurate identification and appropriate management of this condition. Diagnosis-additional radioniucid scans  In cases where radiographic changes on plain films or CT scans are inconclusive or absent, additional radionuclide scans may be considered for the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, particularly when there is a high suspicion for osteomyelitis. However, labeled-leukocyte scans or three-phase bone scintigraphy are not typically recommended due to their high rates of false-positive and false-negative results. Alternative radionuclide imaging modalities that may be used include: 1. Gallium imaging(fig.5a): Gallium scans can be employed to detect areas of infection or inflammation and are useful in cases where spondylodiscitis is suspected but not clearly visualized on other imaging modalities. 2. FDG-PET(fig.5b): Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging has a high negative predictive value close to 100% for detecting spondylodiscitis. It offers good specificity, but caution is needed as PET scans can be positive in conditions such as tumors, degenerative spinal disease, or in the presence of spinal implants. \nFig.5a                                                              Fig.5b Treatment - principles The treatment of spondylodiscitis follows key principles: ● Antimicrobial therapy tailored to the identified pathogen once a microbiologic diagnosis is confirmed, along with percutaneous drainage of paravertebral abscesses if necessary. \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz ● Delaying antibiotic initiation until a microbiologic diagnosis is confirmed, unless there are urgent situations like neurologic compromise or sepsis where empiric antibiotic treatment is warranted. ● Initial use of intravenous (IV) antibiotics to ensure systemic distribution and efficacy during the acute phase of treatment. ● Antibiotic treatment duration of several weeks, with longer courses (8 to 12 weeks) required for cases with undrained abscesses, drug-resistant organisms, or extensive bone destruction. ● Routine follow-up imaging studies are generally not needed initially, as imaging findings may worsen before showing improvement.  Initial IV antibiotics  When initiating intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for spondylodiscitis, the choice of antibiotics should ideally be guided by the identified pathogen through microbiological diagnosis. However, in cases where a specific pathogen has not been identified (no diagnosis), empiric antibiotic treatment may be initiated based on common causative organisms and local resistance patterns. \nFig.6 Treatment-presence of hardware The prognosis of spondylodiscitis is generally favorable with appropriate therapy, but there are potential complications and factors that can impact outcomes: ● Most patients experience gradual improvement in back pain with the initiation of therapy, and pain typically resolves after bone fusion occurs. ● Complications may include neurologic impairment due to abscess formation or bony collapse, with a prevalence of 16%. ● Relapse occurs in approximately 14% of cases, with a higher rate associated with Staphylococcus aureus infections. ● Residual symptoms, mainly back pain, persist in about 31-32% of patients post-treatment, and major depression can also be a complication. ● Delay in diagnosis is a significant risk factor for poor outcomes. \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz In retrospective studies, all-cause mortality was reported at 11%, with 43% of patients undergoing surgery (successful in 79%). Risk factors for death or residual symptoms included neurologic compromise at diagnosis, nosocomial infection acquisition, and delay in diagnosis. Morbidity and mortality tend to increase with age, delayed diagnosis, multiple comorbidities, frailty, and concomitant infective endocarditis. Overall mortality is low, with less than 5% reported (pre-antibiotic era rates were around 25%), and residual neurological deficits are seen in 7% of cases. In a large retrospective study, in-hospital mortality was 6% and largely influenced by comorbidities such as diabetes, end-stage kidney disease, cirrhosis, and malignancy. TB spondylitis – Pott’s disease fig.7 Tuberculous spondylitis, also known as Pott's disease, typically affects the dorsal (thoracic) vertebrae, although it can also involve the lumbar region. It is a slow but destructive disease characterized by vertebral fractures leading to kyphosis, a forward curvature of the spine. Patients may present with cold abscesses in the back, a collection of pus formed as a result of the tuberculosis infection. The diagnosis of TB spondylitis is often confirmed through biopsy or drainage of paravertebral abscesses. These procedures help identify the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, and guide appropriate treatment strategies. Early detection and management of Pott's disease are crucial to prevent complications such as spinal deformity and neurological deficits .Historically, the treatment of Pott's disease included heliotherapy (sunlight exposure) and bed rest as part of the management strategy. Sunlight exposure, specifically ultraviolet (UV) light, was believed to have beneficial effects on tuberculosis infections, as UV light has antimicrobial properties that can help in the treatment of the disease. Additionally, bed rest was commonly prescribed to patients with Pott's disease to reduce spinal stress and prevent further damage to the affected vertebrae. Resting in bed was thought to promote healing and alleviate pain associated with the condition \n                                 Fig.7 Discitis Discitis, or inflammation of the intervertebral disc, is a condition that can occur in children but is less common than in adults. The intervertebral disc consists of the nucleus pulposus, \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz which is a semigelatinous material containing a high percentage of water (70-90%), and the annulus fibrosus, which has a hyaline circular surface. The disc is avascular from around 30 years of age, making microinfarctions more frequent in adults and potentially leading to more severe disease. In children, discitis is often seen in those younger than 4 years of age and is typically associated with fever. In adults, the exact incidence is unknown, and discitis is sometimes grouped with spondylodiscitis. Lumbar disc involvement is common in discitis and may occur as a metastatic localization of sepsis originating from sources such as urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, or following urinary tract interventions. Risk factors for discitis in adults may include intravenous drug use, obesity, and diabetes. The treatment of discitis, particularly in post-surgical cases, may involve similar approaches to those used for spondylodiscitis, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy and appropriate management of associated complications.  Prosthetic Joint infections Definition Prosthetic joint infection  refers to an infection involving a joint prosthesis, with the hip, knee, and shoulder being the most commonly affected joints. PJI is typically classified based on the time of onset following joint replacement surgery, although there is some controversy regarding the classification criteria. The classification of prosthetic joint infections often includes the following categories:  1. Early-onset PJI: Infections that occur within the first three months after joint replacement surgery are classified as early-onset PJI.  2. Delayed-onset PJI: Infections that occur between three to twelve months after the initial joint replacement surgery are categorized as delayed-onset PJI.  3. Late-onset PJI: Infections that occur more than twelve months after the joint replacement surgery are considered late-onset PJI. Fig.8        \n   \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz  Epidemiology The epidemiology of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) is influenced by several factors, including the increasing number of arthroplasties performed worldwide. In the United States alone, approximately 1 million hip and knee arthroplasties are conducted each year. The risk of developing a prosthetic joint infection varies based on the location of the joint replacement, with higher rates observed in the first two years following surgery. The incidence of PJI is generally reported to be around 0.5-2% for knee arthroplasties, which are at greater risk due to their increased mobility and less soft tissue protection. For hip arthroplasties, the incidence is typically in the range of 0.5-1%, while shoulder arthroplasties have an incidence of less than 1%. The specific bacteria responsible for prosthetic joint infections in different joint replacements may vary. However, there are conflicting results in the literature regarding the overall incidence trends of PJI, with some studies suggesting a stable incidence rate while others report increasing or decreasing trends over time. Pathogenesis-risk factors The pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infections involves various risk factors that contribute to the development of these infections. Some important risk factors associated with an increased likelihood of PJI include: 1. Presence of comorbidities: Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, obesity, lymphedema, and immunosuppression can weaken the immune system and predispose individuals to infections, including PJI. 2. Use of certain medications: The use of prednisone, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and other biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs can impact immune function and increase the risk of infections. 3. History of prior arthroplasty or prior infection at the surgical site: Previous joint replacement surgeries or infections at the surgical site can increase the risk of subsequent PJI. 4. ASA score ≥3: A higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, which reflects the overall health status and comorbidities of a patient, is associated with an increased risk of PJI. 5. Prolonged duration of surgery: Lengthy surgical procedures can increase the risk of PJI due to prolonged exposure of the surgical site to potential pathogens. 6. Postoperative complications: Complications such as hematoma formation or wound dehiscence following surgery can create an environment conducive to infection and increase the risk of PJI. 7. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: Bacterial bloodstream infections, particularly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, can lead to seeding of the joint prosthesis and subsequent development of PJI. Pathogenesis-biofilm 21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz Prosthetic joint infections  present challenges in treatment due to factors that affect antibiotic efficacy and the development of antibiotic resistance. The establishment of biofilms on prosthetic surfaces can alter antibiotic mechanisms and hinder their penetration, limiting their effectiveness in eradicating the infection. Additionally, there is a logarithmic decline in antibiotic susceptibility once the biofilm forms, leading to reduced antibiotic efficacy over time. Although patients with PJI may initially respond to antibiotic treatment, there is a risk of relapse within days or months after stopping antibiotics, unless the infected hardware (prosthesis) is removed. The biofilm acts as a reservoir for bacteria, contributing to recurrent or persistent infections. Fig.9 \n  Aetiology The etiology of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) is diverse, with pathogens often originating from the skin flora, which is typically considered sterile. \nFig.10  Clinical Presentation – early onset (< 3 months) In early-onset prosthetic joint infections (PJI) occurring within the first three months after implantation, patients may present with clinical signs and symptoms indicative of infection shortly after the surgical procedure. Common manifestations of early-onset PJI include \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz surgical site issues like wound dehiscence, hematoma, or superficial necrosis at the incision site. Joint-related symptoms such as pain, warmth, erythema, induration, and edema at the incision site may also be observed. Additionally, patients may experience wound drainage or dehiscence, joint effusion (fluid accumulation), and fever as systemic signs of infection. Clinical Presentation – delayed onset (3-12 months) In delayed-onset prosthetic joint infections (PJI) occurring between 3 to 12 months after implantation, the clinical presentation tends to be insidious and challenging to distinguish from other causes of joint symptoms. Patients may experience a more gradual onset of symptoms, including persistent joint pain and potential early signs of implant loosening. Fever, though present in about half of cases, can indicate a systemic response to the infection. The development of a sinus tract, a draining channel from the infected joint to the skin surface, is a characteristic feature that aids in diagnosing PJI. Physical examination findings may be minimal, complicating the differentiation between infection and aseptic failure of the joint prosthesis Clinical Presentation – late onset (>12 months) In cases of late-onset prosthetic joint infections (PJI) occurring more than 12 months after implantation, approximately 50% of cases are associated with hematogenous spread from infections at other sites, such as central venous catheters, urinary tract infections, or skin and soft tissue infections. The clinical presentation of late-onset PJI typically includes an acute onset of symptoms, with patients experiencing a sudden onset of symptoms despite having had a previously well-functioning joint. Common manifestations include joint pain, warmth, erythema at the incision site, induration, and edema, along with joint effusion contributing to joint symptoms. Systemic symptoms like fever can also be present as part of the body's response to the infection. Late-onset PJI may lead to joint instability and potential dislocation, indicating advanced stages of infection. Recognizing the acute presentation of symptoms, the joint-related signs, and the history of hematogenous spread from another infection site is crucial for diagnosing late-onset PJI.     Clinical presentation-source control (fig.11) The source of infection plays a critical role in determining the clinical presentation and management. The origin of PJI can be categorized into known and unknown sources, with varying percentages attributed to different locations. Here, the professor only pointed out the oral cavity (13 %) and the urinary tract ( 12%). 21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz Fig. 11 \nDiagnosis-initial assessment  The diagnostic approach involves an initial assessment that includes plain radiography and serum markers like ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein). If a sinus tract is not evident, diagnostic arthrocentesis is performed to analyze synovial fluid, including WBC (white blood cell count), LE (leukocyte esterase), crystal analysis, alpha-defensin levels, and microbial cultures (Gram stain and culture). In cases of chronic, indolent, or refractory infections, previously culture-negative infections, or immunosuppressed patients, additional testing such as mycobacterial and fungal cultures may be necessary to identify the causative pathogens accurately. This comprehensive diagnostic approach helps clinicians determine the presence of PJI, differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes of joint symptoms, and guide appropriate treatment strategies for optimal patient outcomes  Treatment options 1. DAIR (Debridement, Antibiotics, and Implant Retention): This is a procedure where the infected joint is debrided, antibiotics are administered, and the prosthetic components are retained. This is typically used for early, acute infections. 2. DAPRI (Debridement, Antibiotics, and Prosthesis Retention with Irrigation): Similar to DAIR, but with the addition of thorough irrigation of the joint. This may be used for more established infections. 3. One-stage revision: This involves removing the infected prosthetic components and replacing them with new components in a single surgery. This may be considered for certain cases of prosthetic joint infection. 4. Two-stage revision: This involves removing the infected prosthetic components, placing a temporary spacer with antibiotics, treating the infection, and then replacing the components in a second surgery. This is often used for chronic or difficult-to-treat infections. 5. Arthrodesis: This involves fusing the joint together to eliminate movement. This may be considered in cases of severe infection or failed joint replacement. \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz 6. Girdlestone procedure: This involves removing the prosthetic components and leaving the joint un-replaced. This may be considered in cases of severe infection or poor bone quality. 7. Amputation: In severe cases of infection or failed joint replacement, amputation may be necessary to control the infection and improve quality of life. 8. Suppressive antibiotic treatment: In cases where complete eradication of the infection is not possible, long-term suppressive antibiotic therapy may be considered to control the infection and prevent further complications.   Diabetic foot  Epidemiology  The epidemiology of diabetic foot complications is significant, with a high prevalence and associated risks. Individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes have a lifetime risk of developing diabetic foot issues of up to 34%. This high risk is reflected in the annual incidence of approximately 18.6 million cases per year, indicating a substantial number of individuals affected by diabetes globally. Diabetic foot complications are associated with a range of risks, including a high likelihood of hospitalization, re-admission, amputation (up to 20% of cases), and a mortality risk 2.5 times higher than individuals without diabetic foot problems. These risks underscore the severity and impact of diabetic foot issues on individuals with diabetes. Foot ulcers are a common complication, affecting around 50% of individuals with diabetes. These ulcers can lead to further complications such as osteomyelitis (bone infection), cellulitis (skin infection), sepsis (systemic infection), and gangrene (tissue death). These complications can result in long-term disability and significantly impact the quality of life of affected individuals. Overall, diabetic foot complications pose a serious health concern, contributing to morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life in individuals with diabetes.  Risk factors Risk factors include : 1. Previous foot ulceration: Individuals with a history of foot ulcers are at a higher risk of recurrence, with more than 50% experiencing recurrences within 5 years. 2. Neuropathy: Neuropathy is present in up to 80% of patients with diabetic foot complications. It leads to the loss of sensation of pain and pressure, making individuals more susceptible to minor traumas. Additionally, neuropathy causes impaired microcirculation and compromised skin integrity. 3. Foot deformity: Foot deformities, such as hammer toes and Charcot's foot, are associated with neuropathy and increase the risk of diabetic foot issues. 21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz 4. Vascular disease (peripheral artery disease): Peripheral artery disease results in reduced blood flow to the feet, leading to poor wound healing and increased risk of complications. 5. Medications: Some medications, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, may have potential associations with diabetic foot complications. For example, certain medications may increase the risk of urinary tract infections. 6. Age and ethnicity: In the United States, younger individuals from black, Native American, or Hispanic populations may be at higher risk of diabetic foot complications. Social factors, access to healthcare, nutrition status, and overall health care access can contribute to these disparities. 7. Rural or low-income areas: Individuals living in rural or low-income areas may face challenges accessing medical care, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot issues.   Clinical assessments  Clinical assessments for diabetic foot complications may include: 1. Ankle-brachial index (ABI): The ABI is a non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in the ankle to the blood pressure in the arm. A low ABI may indicate peripheral artery disease (PAD), which can affect blood flow to the legs and feet. 2. Resistance Toe Pressure: It assesses the pressure required to compress the toe and can provide information about the blood flow in the foot. Low resistance toe pressure may indicate compromised vascular health \nFig.12  Ulcer classifications  Professor skipped the slide mentioning only that there are many ulcer classifications. \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz Fig.13 \n Management Some key management strategies include: 1. Complete evaluation: A thorough assessment of the individual with diabetic foot complications is essential. This evaluation may include assessing nutrition status, consulting with vascular surgeons to address vascular issues, and identifying any underlying risk factors that may contribute to foot problems. 2. Sharp debridement: Debridement involves the removal of dead or infected tissue from the wound to promote healing and prevent infection. Sharp debridement is a common technique used to clean and prepare the wound for proper healing. 3. Proper, personalized wound coverage: Wound care plays a crucial role in managing diabetic foot ulcers. Proper wound coverage, such as dressings or advanced wound care products, helps create a conducive environment for healing and prevents infection. 4. Pressure reduction: Mechanical offloading techniques, such as using casts, orthotic devices, or specialized footwear, can help reduce pressure on the affected foot and prevent further damage to the wound. Offloading is an essential component of diabetic foot ulcer management. 5. Prevention of relapses: Preventing the recurrence of diabetic foot complications is crucial. This may involve patient education on foot care, regular monitoring of foot health, and implementing preventive measures to reduce the risk of future ulcers or complications.  Local care Local care for diabetic foot ulcers is essential in promoting wound healing and preventing complications.It includes debridement, which involves the removal of dead or infected tissue from the wound bed, plays a crucial role in creating a clean environment for healing and reducing the risk of infection. Different debridement methods, such as sharp debridement or enzymatic debridement, may be employed based on individual wound characteristics. Proper wound dressings are vital for managing diabetic foot ulcers as they help maintain a moist healing environment, protect the wound from contaminants, and support the healing process. Various types of dressings, including hydrocolloid, foam, or alginate dressings, are used depending on the wound's specific needs. Adjunctive local \n21.05.2024                                                                                                                      CALCAGNO L.16 \nNikola Pavlos, Vittorino Beatriz therapies, such as Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) or Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC), can further enhance wound healing. NPWT applies negative pressure to the wound, promoting fluid removal, reducing edema, and stimulating tissue granulation. Skin grafts and substitutes may be considered for non-infected, non-ischemic wounds to support wound closure. Additionally, Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy and local oxygen therapy can improve oxygen delivery to the tissues, aiding in the healing process.                                                                    Fig.14 \n  Treatment of Diabetic foot infection The prevention and treatment of diabetic foot infections require a collaborative approach involving  surgeons and infectious disease specialists.To prevent diabetic foot infections, individuals with diabetes should practice proper foot care, including regular foot inspections, keeping the feet clean and dry, and wearing suitable footwear. Maintaining optimal blood sugar levels through glycemic control is essential to reduce the risk of diabetic complications, including foot infections. Regular foot exams by healthcare providers can help detect any issues early and prevent infections from developing. In the treatment of diabetic foot infections, obtaining tissue samples for culture and sensitivity is crucial before initiating empirical therapy. This allows for targeted antibiotic treatment based on the specific pathogens identified in the wound. Diabetic foot infections can be caused by various pathogens, including Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacilli, anaerobes, and polymicrobial organisms, often exacerbated by impaired immunity in individuals with diabetes. The duration of antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot infections depends on factors such as the extent of tissue involvement (soft tissues, bone), presence of ischemia, and the risk of relapses. Tailoring the duration of treatment to these factors is essential for successful management and resolution of the infection.", "input": "", "output": "- what is it >>>\n    - an infection of the bone\n    -

There are different classifications according to the clinical presentation (acute/hyper-acute or subacute-chronic), according to the organism, etiology and progression, infection of a native valve or prosthetic valve.   The concept of endocarditis as a disease is mainly due to Sir William Osler, a medical doctor, who, in 1885, presented a sort of unifying theory in which he said that only susceptible patients could develop endocarditis which is a relatively rare disease. These patients could develop a mycotic endocarditis due to mycotic growths on their valves followed by transference to distant parts of microorganisms leading to the formation of an embolus which is the most important complication of endocarditis.   The characteristic lesion is the vegetation which is a sort of matrix made by fibrin, components of blood, microorganisms and inflammatory cells that can grow on the valve or on the endocardium. Normal valvular endothelium is resistant to bacterial colonization; indeed, we are subjected to a lot of bacteria in our lives (even asymptomatic) and thanks to this resistance in order to develop endocarditis the simultaneous occurrence of several independent factors is needed. These factors are:  - Alteration of the cardiac valve surface to produce a suitable site of attachment for bacteria permitting their colonization. This is the case of the areas of turbulence or other alterations of the valvular surface. - Presence of bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) that are able to attach and proliferate on the valvular surface. - Creation of a vegetation by burying of proliferating organisms within a protective matrix of serum molecules (such as fibrin) and platelets.    PATHOGENESIS - Altered valve surface: there are some animal experiments that suggests that endocarditis is almost impossible to establish on a perfect valve surface. The first step of endocarditis is the deposition on the surface of fibrin and platelets giving rise to a nonbacterial thrombotic vegetation (NBTC). Bacteria find this very suitable environment and attach to it and then are covered by more fibrin and protected from neutrophils. Bacteria start to divide permitting the formation of a mature vegetation.  - Hemodynamic factors: the presence of hemodynamic alterations and turbulence of blood in correspondence of valves can help the bacterial colonization. The degrees of turbulence of valvular stenosis, for example, can make longer the possible time of attachment of bacteria to the surface.  In fig.1 is possible to see that bacteria can enter the bloodstream by an intravenous catheter in hospital or by injection of drugs and attach in case of alteration of part of the endothelium due to lesions or \n10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n2 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco inflammations due to rheumatic disorders, atherosclerosis, turbulence or any kind of valvulopathy. They start proliferating and then they disseminate creating emboli.   SITE OF INFECTION Left valves are more commonly infected than right ones and the aortic valve is more commonly infected then the mitral one. In some cases, there could be the concomitant infection of mitral and aortic valve.  The aortic infection is the most frequent and the vegetation is usually on the ventricular side affecting all the three cusps. The problem is that in case of aggressive bacteria such as Staphylococcus Aureus you can have damage of the valve with perforation and consequent dysfunction or even root abscesses. In case of mitral involvement, the problem is related to dysfunction by rupture of chordae tendinae.   In fig. 2 we have a schematic view of the pathogenesis of endocarditis. On the left we can see the important factors for the bacterial source. The most important agents are Staphylococci and Streptococci. On the right is indicated how bacteria attach to an abnormal substrate leading to the formation of thrombi. Prosthetic valve per se, for example, is considered a surface suitable for bacterial attachment.   In fig. 3 the mitral valve is represented; some vegetations (yellow nodules) are present on the ventricular side. They can damage the chordae tendinae. In the upper part of fig. 3 there is an echocardiography in which it is possible to see the mass of vegetation (yellow arrow).   EPIDEMIOLOGY From the epidemiological point of view the scenario has changed in the last decades due to the increased longevity of people and also due to new predisposing factors such as the widespread use of prosthetic valves and also due to the potential of nosocomial infections.  In US and Western countries endocarditis is considered, from a cardiological point of view, quite a rare disease, between 2 and 6 cases per 100 000 person/year. More frequent in males than in females with a mean age of 47-69, while in the past was more frequent in young adults between 30-40 years old and this change is due to the change in predisposing factors; in the past, the most important predisposing factor were rheumatic diseases that affected mostly young people, now these diseases are very infrequent in Western countries, while now the most important factor is the alteration of the valvular function due to the increased longevity and increased exposure to nosocomial bacteria. Group of people that remain at very high risk are the intravenous drug users (2000 person/year).   PROSTHETIC VALVES The use of prosthetic valves represents 7-25% of cases of infective endocarditis. The rate of risk is higher in the first month after surgery and is higher for mechanical valves than biological ones.  \n10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n3 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco - Early endocarditis: within 2 months surgery  - Late endocarditis: 12 months post surgery  In the middle there is a sort of grey zone with a gradient of distribution form early to late. The type of onset (early or late) is due to a different kind of etiology. The early one is hospital acquired, related to surgery, the late one is a community acquired endocarditis and is similar to the endocarditis of native valves.   NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS In 7-29% of cases is due to hospital materials, such as intravascular devices, or due procedure on the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract.  RISK FACTORS There are cardiac and non-cardiac risk factors:  - Cardiac risk factors:  o Previous infective endocarditis: this is one of the most important risk factors due to the alteration of the valvular surface o Valvular heart disease o Prosthetic heart valve  o Central venous or arterial catheter  o Transvenous cardiac implantable electronic device  o Congenital heart disease  - Non-cardiac risk factors:  o Central venous catheter o People who inject drugs  o Immunosuppression  o Recent dental or surgical procedures o Recent hospitalization  o Hemodialysis   We have to keep in mind all these possibilities in order to have an idea of the possible diagnosis for the patient.   - High risk factors:  o Previous IE  o Aortic valve disease  o Rheumatic valve disease (not so frequent now)  o Prosthetic valve o Congenital heart defects   - Moderate risk:  o Mitral stenosis  o Pulmonary stenosis  o Tricuspid valve defects   - HIV infection:  o A number of cases of IE have been reported in patients with HIV infection  o It has been suggested that HIV infection is an independent risk factor for IE in IDU  10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n4 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco  - Rheumatic valve disease:  o Predisposition for young in some countries 37%-76% of cases  o Mitral 85%, Aortic 50% o Degenerative valvular lesions  o MV Prolapse and associated mitral regurgitation - 5 to 8 times higher IE risk  o Aortic valve disease (stenosis or/and regurgitation) is present in 12 to 30 % of cases   ETIOLOGY  Which are the bacteria mostly involved in this disease? Most of them are Gram + and very common ones are Streptococci: - Viridans streptococci or alpha-hemolytic streptococci are present in the oral microbioma (S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. oralis) - S. bovis group: the most important is S. gallolyticus. These bacteria are part of the gastrointestinal microbiota and generally the presence of endocarditis caused by them is associated with the presence of a carcinoma in the colon, indeed it is important to perform a colonoscopy. Per se these bacteria are not dangerous.   Another group pf bacteria responsible for the diseases is the one of Enterococci, in particular E. faecalis and E. faecium. They are very specific for the valves and are associated with gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract procedures. It is important to remember that approximately 10% of patients with enterococcal bacteremia can develop endocarditis.  Staphylococci are the most important bacteria causing endocarditis, in particular S. aureus that has a high degree of virulence which leads to different clinical courses. Also coagulase-negative staphylococci can cause endocarditis, they tend to localize on prosthetic valves.   There are few cases due to Gram – rods:  - HACEK group (Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae) that are part of the oral microbioma with very slow and that need extended culture (7-10 days) to be isolated growth.  - E. coli, Klebisiella  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa - Nisseria gonorrhoae   Other etiological agents:  - Fungi, such as Candida species which generates a very severe clinical condition especially in hospitalized patients and immunosuppressed patients.  - Q fever  - Chlamydia  - Bartonella  - Legionella  In fig. 5 we can see the clear difference in the early infection (within 2 months) and late infection (after \n10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n5 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco 1 year) in the case of prosthetic valves. Within 2 months we have a nosocomial infection, the most frequent agents are coagulase – staphylococci and then S. aureus. After 12 months the epidemiology is very similar to the one of endocarditis on native valves; streptococci are the main agents involved, followed by staphylococci and then by coagulase – staphylococci.    SYMPTOMS From a clinical point of view, we can have a patient presenting with an acute form or with a subacute form.  - Acute form: patient with fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain; all these symptoms usually appear after 1-2 weeks from the initiating bacteremia. This form is mainly caused by S. aureus which is a very virulent agent.  - Subacute form: lower symptoms such as lower grade fever, weight loss, fatigue, arthralgia and myalgia. This form is mainly caused by S. epidermidis.  When should I suspect of a subacute infective endocarditis (SBE)? The fever is of unknown origin (FUO), low grade and intermittent (4-10 days). Another sign is the presence of heart murmurs or worsening of preexistent heart murmurs. Patients with endocarditis are subjected to embolization. During the physical examination is important to notice the presence of some skin signs which are all due to microembolizations.  o petechiae (on extremities or mucous membranes such as conjunctiva) o subungual hemorrhages (Fig. 6, linear lesions under the nail bed) o Osler nodes (Fig. 7, specific of endocarditis, painful located on the pulp of fingers and toes, more common in subacute IE) o Janeway lesions (Fig. 8, erythematous, blanching macules, not painful and located on palms and soles) o Roth spots (Fig. 9, present at the retina level, are areas of embolization which can be seen during the ophthalmological consultation).           In the case of acute bacterial endocarditis (ABE) is easier to find signs of microembolization: - Stroke: this is the most common neurologic sign  - Renal failure  - Septic emboli - Sepsis \n10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n6 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco - Congestive heart failure: due to local damage of the valves  When we see the patient for the first time sometimes complications are already present, especially in case of acute infective endocarditis. So, it is important to evaluate the neurological activity of the patient, the presence of micro emboli etc.  A case of difficult diagnosis is when a prosthetic valve is present; usually bacteria with low virulence are involved, such as coagulase – streptococci. The patient usually has low fever of unknown origin, but in case of early involvement we can have also an acute presentation, a local invasive endocarditis with congestive heart failure and murmurs.    DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis of IE is based on: 1. Clinical suspicion:  a. Fever of unknown origin b. Evaluation of risk factors  c. Physical examination    2. Consistent microbiological data: in 2023 the European Society of Cardiology defined the modified diagnostic criteria of IE. Inside the blood there must be the presence of bacteria 🡪 blood culture positive for the most important etiological agents of endocarditis (Fig. 10).     3. IE-related cardiac lesions by imaging: echocardiography (TTE= trans-esophageal and TOE= trans-thoracic), cardiac CT, PET.  In fig. 11 we have the recommendation for the echocardiography.  In case of inconclusive echocardiography, we can use cardiac CT especially in patients with native valves, or PET especially in patients with prosthetic valves.   Sometimes, it can happen that we have the evidence of endocarditis with imaging, but negative blood cultures. There are some rare etiological agents, especially intracellular bacteria, which do not result from blood culture, but just from serology or with other techniques. These agents are: - Brucella spp. - C. burnetiid - Bartonella spp.  - Legionella spp.  - Fungi   Imaging and blood culture are considered the two pillars or major criteria, but there are also 5 minor criteria which are the clinical ones such as fever, predisposing conditions, embolic vascular dissemination, immunological phenomena and microbiological evidence (Fig. 12). \n10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n7 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco The IE classification states that we have a definitive diagnosis of endocarditis if:  - 2 major criteria are present (blood culture + imaging) - 1 major criteria and at least 3 minor criteria are present - 5 minor criteria are present In the other cases we have a possible diagnosis or a rejected one.   COMPLICATIONS  As we already said, the complications can be present already at the patient presentation. There are four different etiologies:  1. Embolic: the predictors of this complications are the size of the vegetation, the vegetation present on the left side and the presence of S. aureus, S. Bovis and Candida. Embolic complication can lead to stroke, myocardial infarction, ischemic limbs, hypoxia from pulmonary emboli and abdominal pain due to infarction at the level of the kidneys or spleen. In fig. 12 we can see a case of right side infective endocarditis; less frequent and specific of intravenous drug users, caused by staphylococci aureus or epidermidis which are present in the normal flora of the skin. The embolization from the right side of the heart goes into the lungs giving rise to pneumonia and pulmonary damages.    2. Local spread of infection can lead to extensive valvular damage, paravalvular abscess (caused mainly by S. aureus, pericarditis (very severe risk of mortality), formation of fistulous intracardiac connections. In fig. 13 we can see a perforation of the aortic valve and the presence of vegetations over it. On the right of fig. 13 we have an open mitral valve with acute S. aureus and abscess extending to the myocardium.     \n10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n8 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco 3.

Formation of immune complexes leading to glomerulonephritis and arthritis.    THERAPY The principal of therapy is that we have to use drugs in high doses because we have to achieve a sustained bactericidal serum concentration. The duration of the therapy Is about 4-10 weeks because it has to be sufficient to eradicate microorganisms growing in the valvular vegetation. To increase the power of the therapy there are also combinations of antibiotics that can be used together. For this reason, the therapy is usually administered intravenously for the entire duration of the treatment. The right antibiotic must be used at the right dosage and so it is fundamental to know which bacterium is involved in order to understand the MIC (minimum inhibiting concentration) of the antibiotic. It is also important to repeat the blood culture in order to demonstrate that the lesion has been sterilized from bacteria.  In general, a first echocardiography is performed before starting the therapy, a second one after 2 weeks to confirm that the antibiotic is working and a last one at the end of the treatment.   - Streptococci/Enterococci therapy o Determine MIC of Penicillin (MIC is the value you have on the antibiogram that is needed to define the susceptibility of the microorganism)  o Penicillin +/- aminoglycoside  o Ceftriaxone alone  o Vancomycin +/- aminoglycoside, used in case of allergy or inefficacy of Penicillin - HACEK group o Cefotaxime/ceftriaxone  - Staphylococci o If present on native valve ▪ Flucloxacillin +/- aminoglycoside ▪ Vancomycin +/- aminoglycoside/ rifampicin  o If present on prosthetic valves (even if i many cases they require surgery, but we can try to maximize the antibiotic treatment with 3 antibiotics at the same time especially with S. aureus) ▪ Flucloxacillin + aminoglycoside + rifampicin  ▪ Vancomycin + aminoglycoside + rifampicin   Until now, the treatment had to be intravenously administered, not orally, but in new guidelines is reported that in some cases, based on the fact that there are no complications, no S. aureus presence etc, we can try with an oral administration of the therapy after 2 weeks of IV treatment (Fig. 14). OPAT is the oral therapy \n10.04.2024                                                                                                                                                       BONORA L.10 \n9 Allegra Zogheri, Elena Picco done at home.

All these factors can create a high risk for bacteremia and so it is important to do the prophylaxis 1-2 hours before the beginning of the procedure using 2gm of Amoxicillin orally or other drugs.  This prophylaxis decreases the possibility for bacteria to attach on altered valves.  \n Look at fig. 16 for prevention measures.  \n  \nFigure 16", "input": "", "output": "- Epidemiology >>>\n    - subjects with prosthetic devices in heart\n    - elderly at risk\n- \n- Etiology >>>\n    - S.aureus - main one \n    - B.streptococci\n    - Candida\n- \n- Pathology >>>\n    - most commonly occurs due to Sepsis and/or Systemic Embolization\n    - presence of bacteria and/or fungi in bloodstream\n    - bacteria attach to damaged valve surfaces, forming nonbacterial thrombotic vegetations, due to turbulence\n    - bacteria proliferate within vegetation, protected from immune response\n- \n- \n- clinical manifestations - symptoms >>>\n    - acute form:\n        - rapid onset of fever\n        - chills\n        - shortness of breath, chest pain\n        - all occur after 1-2 weeks of bacteremia\n        - commonly associated with S.aureus\n    - subacute form:\n        - milder symptoms, like low-grade fever\n        - fatigue\n        - weight loss\n        - arthralgia\n        - linked to less aggressive Coag- staphylococci\n- \n- Clinical signs >>>\n    - embolic phenomena\n        - petechiae\n        - Osler nodes - painful lesions on fingers/toes\n        - Janeway lesions - painless macules on palms/soles\n        - Roth spots - retinal emboli\n    - Heart murmurs\n        - new or worsening murmurs due to valvular dysfunction\n- \n- transmission >>>\n    - intravenous catheters or drug injections \n    - dental procedures or surgical interventions\n    - individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, prosthetic valves, & IV drug users\n    - so bacteria enter bloodstream through these routes\n- \n- diagnosis >>>\n    - clinical suspicion - based on symptoms, RF, physical examination\n    - Blood cultures - must show bacterial presence\n    - Imaging; echocardiography, essential for identifying cardiac lesions\n    - criteria: 2 positive blood cultures + positive echocardiography\n- \n- Treatment >>>\n    - IV systemic HIGH dose Bactericidal antibiotics for 4 weeks & 6-8 weeks for patients w/ prosthetic valves\n    - cardiac surgery - for severe cases w/ significant valvular dmg, uncontrolled infection, or large vegetations\n- \n- complications >>>\n    - risk for metastatic spread - secondary infections in kidneys, brain\n    - local spread ⇒ valvular dmg, pericarditis\n    - embolic complications - can lead to stroke, MI, organ dmg\n-"}

And they usually go on differential diagnosis because a lot of things might present in the brain. And some of the concerns and some support that you get are how they might be differentiated between infections and cancers. Well, the definition (fig.1) is usually the collection of pus in the middle of the brain. It usually starts with an area of cerebritis, so there's an area of inflammation, focal inflammation of the brain for example, that organizes usually in two to five days and get a capsule. So in the end, we get brain masses. In recent years, we have seen much more early abscesses than before, because the imaging part is more used than before. If you compare the case series we have now to those like 30 years ago, they're kind of very different in terms of mortality, for example.  Over time, apart from being better at diagnosing, we had a decrease in otogenic abscesses, so people with holes in their teeth who have abscesses that evolved into brain abscesses, and more post-traumatic or post-operative, so people are being operated by the surgeons and again, it's a complication. This is the reason that now we have a lower mortality rate than before: 0-24% (fig.1).  So that's a very complex slide (fig.2). But I just want to tell you that we see, is very different according to the probable origin. Most of the abscesses that we see now are actually a sequence of otitis media and otomastoiditis. So, the majority of them are streptococci, both anaerobic and aerobic. Streptococci live in the mouth, so they actually can colonize all the sinuses and also the ears. There are several causes; in certain cases, like, for example, in the cyclic neutropenia, cancer patients in chemotherapy,  usually undergo nutropenia after chemotherapy and it's very common to have a gram- bacteremia. I highlighted that in green (fig.2), because in that setting patients are immunocompromised, so transplant patients that have increased risk of brain abscess. As you can see, there are very uncommon functions, there are very strange fungi, that you usually see only in very limited transplant patients. In that case, it's really impossible to get the diagnosis unless you're really aggressive in just trying to get the material from the brain. We already talked about T. gondii, and it's the most common cause of brain abscess in HIV. We talked about listeria when we talk about aseptic meningitis. We just touched nocardia, that can cause lung infections, but they can be sent into the brain, so you might see cavities in the lungs abscesses, and also at the same time you can see brain abscesses. In low-income countries, TB is the leading cause of brain abscesses.    \nFig.1  \nFig.2  29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           2 LOCALIZATION \nOne thing that's important is actually the place where you see the abscesses, that can give you a hint of where they come from. So, if they're in the front lobes, you must think they come from the sinuses. As you can see, they're sinusitis, or sometimes they have some infections. If you see them in the temporal lobes, from the cerebellum down there, you must think they come from otitis media. If you see multiple sites, they come from the blood. In that case, you want to think, where did they come from? So, source control is very important.  SYMPTOMS \nThey're really variable, in different cases, in different patients. Usually, they should be headache, mental status change, and fever. If you want to have all three at the same time, you get them only in less than 50%. Just have headache, fever, or altered mental status. Don't always think that you need to have all the main symptoms at the same time. And, of course, neurological symptoms depends on the mass effect. So, if it's cortical, it depends on frontal lobes, temporal lobes, occipital lobes, how big is it, how much edema is around the lesions… So, highly variable effect, in terms of neurological symptoms.        \nFig.3  \nFig.4  29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           3 DIAGNOSIS Just to give you an idea, that's how we see the CT scan (fig.5).  It's a round lesion, with a hypodense center, and there's also some hypodense area that's around, that's edema. We usually use corticosteroids, to reduce edema and antibiotics, to just kill what’s inside.  That's an MRI (fig.6). \nYou are estimating not just the abscess itself, but also the amount of edema that's around. This can be totally asymptomatic (fig.6A). In that area, it's a very particular area, you don't have the cortex there. It should compress the white matter, but the white matter is just fibrous, it can just go around the edema, go around the mass. So, this version can be totally asymptomatic.  MANAGEMENT \nThis year we've got new guidelines for brain abscesses, and they say to ask a neurosurgeon every time you see a brain abscess. So, you need to consult, and see if these can be either aspirated or excised.           \nFig.5 \nFig.6A-B-C \nFig.7 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           4 NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS What's the agent causing neurocysticercosis? Tenia. Tenia is a flatworm, with two main types: tenia solium, and tenia saginata. Tenia solium comes from pigs, tenia saginata from cows. Tenia Africa is a version of tenia solium for the east of the world. That's the way we get infected by tenia (fig.9). So, we usually eat uncooked or undercooked meat, and the muscle of these animals have a kind of a dormant form of tenia. So, when we use these undercooked or raw meat, these oncosphere grow up to be an adult tenia. Usually, nothing happens.  People come with abdominal discomfort, some have a little pain, they are not useful for losing weight. People come to say that they have  white things moving in the tools. I think I've already mentioned to you that some people get psychosis. I don't know why some people get a psychosis due to these things, they have white stuff in these tools moving.  Most of them are not real, so if you ask them to bring the tools, you don't see the white thing moving. Last year, an old man came to the outpatient clinic, and he smelled like garlic so terribly I couldn't just stay in the same room without opening the windows. He came with his son, and he was telling me that he had tenia for a long time. Like two years, he showed me pictures, videos, of his tools. He had this white thing moving in these tools, so it was real. But, the GP prescribed the wrong drug. Tenia doesn't respond to venazole. He receive three courses of venazole without response, so he was taking one full garlic a day, for one year, because garlic has some helping elements probably. I, with diagnoses, prescribed the treatment, I told him to stop with garlic, and his son actually told me thank you very much. Usually, nothing happens. It doesn't produce any kind of complication. But, tenia is ermaphrodite, so, it's able to self-impregnate itself. Once some human, that's infected with tenia, defecates somewhere, in the garden, or in the soil,etc. My fruit and vegetable was contaminated by someone's stools, in that case, it don't ingest the oncospheres, I ingest directly, the embroynated eggs, and they hatch into the stomach, in the first part of the intestine, they go through the circulation, and go to the muscle, and brain.  IS IT COMMON? Well, it's very common, because it’s everywhere in the world, it seems to be higher in limited resource countries countries, because of controls on animals. Of course, only in countries where you have pigs, so in Muslim countries they don't consume pig, so you don't have neurocysticercosis. It's considered to be the most frequent cause of seizures, in low resource countries.     \nFig.8 \nFig.9 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           5 HOW DOES IT WORK? What happens usually? Nothing. The cyst stays in the muscles, can be in the eyes, can be in the spine, can be in the brain, can be everywhere. Most of the people, don't have symptoms. However, they can cause seizures, into an extra cortex, and the cyst reactivates, it’s more active, it just moves. So, it causes inflammation in the cortex, seizures, chronic headaches, in certain cases it produces something that's similar to, to encephalitis, and can cause abnormalities in the vessels of the brain.  There are four stages (fig.10): Phase one, in which you see the worm inside. So it's an active condition, with the worm there, there's some degree of inflammation. Phase two is called colloidal vescicular, there you see there's some edema around.      This (fig.11) is a 50 years old woman, coming from the east of Europe, with chronic headache, and you can see the cysts. You see there are around 20 lesions in the brain.  We diagnose it, usually with MRI, but we do have a specific serology.  They can be everywhere, it can also be in the meningi, and that causes seizures. In this case actually, all the lesions are calcified, because they don't heal, they just calcify.      TREATMENT How do we treat? We combine one or two antiepileptic drugs, albedazole, with steroids. They usually work. Depending on numbers, localization, we actually extend the treatment rules.                  \nFig.10 \nFig.11 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           6 AN INTRODUCTION TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OR HOST-ENVIROMENT-MICROORGANISMS INTERACTIONS  Infections are really important. If you take a look at causes of death (fig.12), the green ones are actually infections. They are 3 out of 10 causes of death in the world. If  you go to low income countries, you see that actually 6 out of 10, and the 2 most important causes of death are infections. So, basically, they're really important in terms of mortality when you move to a certain area of the world. They're also important in terms of morbidity. there was a study done in Canada about daily loss because of infections. Just to give you an idea that there's an impact about days loss, morbidity, and other conditions, consequences, like pneumonia, sepsis, UTIs, etcetera, are common causes of infection that we see in high income countries.   INFECTION AND COLONIZATION Well, this is concept number 1 I want to touch, I know it's very basic, but, you know, the consequences of these 2 ideas are really important, in terms of practice. So, that's (fig.14) the difference between infection and colonization. So, colonization is the presence of the microorganism without alteration of structure or function of an organ and tissue. So, you get bacteria somewhere, fungi, protozoa, but the organ or tissue is actually fine, there's no alteration in its function. So, which is the organ that takes more microorganism? The gut, the skin, the mucosa, the mouth it's really full of bacteria.  Infection is actually the presence of a microorganism with the alteration of the function, something doesn't work, think of the gut. Usually, the structure of the gut is not altered, certain infections actually are invasive, so they cause mucosa, and gut alterations, et cetera, but usually it just changes the function, so diarrhea is usually because of accelerated transit in the gut, and then people feel sick. Infections, apart from these I mentioned, can cause changes in the microscopic, or the macroscopic structure of the tissue.  I just put here (fig.15), the Koch’s Postulate, I think you studied it in microbiology, but I wanted to remind you, because we’ll talk about emerging infections afterwards, I think it's important that we think that infections can cause something; when you’ll study IBD, intestinal inflammatory bowel disease, you will study that a certain type of bacteria was linked to Crohn’s disease, when you study mitral sclerosis, you will study that there are certain infections associated with mitral sclerosis, but I think, most of them don't actually follow the Koch’s postulate, so just put them there, I think it's important to consider them, when we try to see the difference between association and causation.   \nFig.12 \nFig.13 \nFig.14 \nFig.15 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           7 Which are the consequences of this? Well, first one is very important. Do not treat colonization. Another professor will teach about antimicrobial stewardship, one of the principles of antimicrobial stewardship is don't treat asymptomatic bacteruria. You have bacteruria, you don't treat it every time you find it, because it depends on symptoms, depends on the presence of nitrates, it depends on risk.   Secondly, with Candida. You have Candida in urines, candida lives in the mucosa. So, if you don't have perfectly sterile withdrawal of the urine, you find candida in urins. It's not an infection, it's just the presence of the fungus in the urine, so don't treat it. Same thing as sputum. If it is sputum culture, you find candida, it comes from the mouth. Candida lives the mouth.  We’ll talk about stewardship, we’ll talk about highly resistant bacteria. We don't treat them. Why? Well, first reason, we are (unintelligible) for treating these bacteria, but we reserve them for severe cases. Second thing these highly resistant bacteria are actually a consequence of the inflammation in the gut microbioma, so if we treat them, two weeks afterwards, there would be again bacteria in the gut, so it's useless. Colonization is not reason for treating, but it's important because we isolate the patients. So, you will see the wards, we do swabs, if it comes positive, we isolate the patient. They should be in a single room, or in a room with other patients with the same resistant bacteria.  There's a second reason why it's important to know that the patient is colonized by resistant bacteria. If they develop a severe infection, we want to cover for this. Imagine we have a patient that’s undergoing liver transplant, we know he’s colonized, they’re a very high risk of patient. Because of the procedure, the immunosuppression, if they develop fever, we won’t treat them, but we have to start prepare for severe infection. Then, when we receive culture, so we go to a very specific narrow situation.  There are really hundreds of studies connecting microbiomas to a lot of diseases, some of them are actually inflammatory conditions, some others are even.  Association doesn't mean causation, it's very important to say this.  The microbiota could change due to bacteria, viruses, fungi it can change with age, it changes with nutrition, with sexual activity…    EXAMPLES OF MICROBIOTA/PATHOGENS INTERACTIONS I wanted to make two examples. The first one is lactobacilli versus candida (fig.19), we said that candidosis is usually a dysbiosis where lactobacilli are reduced.  The second (fig.20) is the changes in the microbiome in clostridioides difficile. It’s a very important colon infection. In hospitalized patients, as a consequence of anti-microbial treatment we have a reduction in certain bacteria in the gut and we have the predominance of clostridium difficile. Clostidium difficile is \nFig.16 \nFig.16 \nFig.17 \nFig.18 \nFig.19 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           8 associated with several complications such as toxic megacolon and death. Because of the changes clostridium creates in the gut microenvironment, we have passage of bacteria from the gut to the blood, so we start with dysbiosis because of antibiotic treatment, we create clostridium infection, clostridium facilitates the passage of bacteria from the gut to the blood.  The interaction between the bacteria inside and outside the gut is very important and it has clinical consequences.  BASICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES WORDS  These (fig.21) are all words we are going to use, such as acute, subacute or chronic, symptomatic versus symptomatic is linked to the host; some infections are asymptomatic, for many years people have no symptoms or an infection, but it changes the immune system.  Primitive and secondary are very important when we do consult with a patient,  often they ask us what is the cause of fever or what is the cause of raised CRV, we need to understand if there is an infection and if that infection comes only from that organ or tissue.  People use the word infectious as a synonym of contagious,  infection means there is a microorganism, contagious that is going to be spreading from person to person.  SPREAD  An infection can be spread by contiguity, there is usually a small way of entry in the skin, and it usually just get down the skin into the dermis and just spread horizontally, so contiguity, and grows and grows until we don't do something about it.  It can spread by be a hematogenous spread when we talk about endocarditis, we see that the infection can just be spread to the blood circulation. The last one is lymphatic spread, the main infection is actually drained by the lymphatic vessel so if you have an infection in the extremities, hands or feet, the lymphatic vessel usually drains out the bacteria or the microorganisms to the lymph nodes. When you have an lymphatic spread you have an infection somewhere in the lymph nodes, that enlarge. In this case (fig.21) it's cat scratch disease, in which after cat scratch or bite bartonella enters the skin, and from the skin it's drained by lymph nodes so usually people present fever, sometimes scratch or bites and the lymph nodes in particular the axillary lymph nodes are enlarged.          \nFig.20 \nFig.21 \nFig.21 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           9 TRANSMISSION ROUTES How can microorganisms actually spread from person to person? The first one is the airborne droplets, we already talked about tuberculosis, neisseria meningitis and influenza.  There are very different patterns of spread, so just to remind you this slide we used for tuberculosis (fig.23):    droplets-> 1m, meningitis; small droplets-> tuberculosis, usually 1 to 2 meter but in close groups it can stay in the air and viruses can spread like air or aerosol it gets to all of us in the same room. Very different kind of distance. The second one (fig.22) is by contact: erisipela potentially can be spread by touching; VZV -> in lesions you get a lot of viruses that can be spread by touching them; also scabies can be spread like that. Concerning varicella, if you remember it usually it is a disease in children and young people, and when you have varicella but also chlamydia you also have the virus in the mouth, in the lungs, so the spread is both by contact and airborne. If you have a patient with varicella you isolate both by air and contact. If we have a patient with zoster we just isolate by contact. We exempt immunocompromised hosts because from the skin varicella virus goes back blood and to lungs, and from lungs in the mouth. So immunocompromised hosts can spread the zoster by airborne transmission. We talked about STIs, we talked a little bit about oro-fecal transmission, we talked about HAV, we will talk about salmonella and Vibrio, and finally we will talk a little bit about vectors when we talk about we will spend some time talking about malaria.  Today we will talk about ticks, some borrelia and we will talk also about leishmania. So, these (fig.22) are the most important paths of transmission.  ARTHROPODS \nWhen we will discuss about arboviruses, that are viruses spread by arthropods, we all think about mosquitoes because they are the most common ones, then we will talk about zika etc, but just let me remind you there are much more arthropods in the world and they can spread a lot of things. Phlebotominae (fig.24) it's pappataci, it can spread a few viruses and leishmania; ticks can spread a lot of things, we’ll just touch borrelia and we can see all these (fig.24); triatomine bugs transmit Chagas disease in South America; mites can sometimes bring rickettsia and Scrub typhus; tse-tse flies cause sleeping sickness (we don’t see many cases); fleas can spread Yersinia pestis; there are also lices; Simulliidae can cause oncocercgiasis; snails, we’ll talk about them when we talk about (unintelligible). So Arthtopods are really a lot of families they can spread a lot of things.  \nFig.22 \nFig.23 \nFig.24 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           10  TOSCANAVIRUS \nPhlebotomus transmits 3 viruses: sicilian virus, naples virus and toscana virus.  Because they were discovered in these areas, there are certain areas in which phlebotomus can reach and spreade a disease. Let's give you an idea of the cases (fig.25): last year we had tuscanavirus most of all in Emilia and Toscana. They are very mild, very quick to resolve.  TICKS \n These are ticks in different stages, you can see they are very small. Usually before eating blood, ticks are so small you don't see them (usually around one millimeter) when they feed on blood it will be at one centimeter and don't stimulate feeding. There are several different ticks they transmit different things. Ixodes is the soft tick, it's usually in wild animals. There are different types in the world.  It’s a disease (fig.28) that in Europe it’s kind of common. There are some countries in which we have more than 10 cases for 100.000 inhabitants, in Germany for example they sell the ticks remover in the supermarket.          \nFig.25 \nFig.26 \nFig.27 \nFig.28 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           11 VECTORS \nWe already started talking about vectors, so I’m just gonna talk about of one health, it's the idea of just bringing together animal health human health and environmental health. It actually comes from this (fig.30), a very famous epidemiological triad. We have at the same time, the host with all the features (age, sex, comorbidities, genetics, etc), we have the pathogen, the agent that can change a lot depending on pathogens differences in terms of virulence and so on, and the environment.  The features of the environment are important for understanding these interactions. Some changes are important think of like rain, humidity, sunlight, temperature, some are actually induced by humans in forestation, in urbanization etc. This example (fig.32) is just how mosquitoes are used at transmitting disease according to temperature, so if the change in temperature keep on with the same as we've seen in the last 20 years, in the next 5 years we'll see a lot of malaria because mosquitoes are very effective between 20 and 30 degrees. If the temperature keep on increasing from 25 to 40, we'll see a lot of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, because mosquitoes can adapt to very high temperature.   In 1997 the vector of dengue was just in certain areas of Italy, in only 10 years it was in he entire country, now is in the the whole middle and south of Europe. There's this very interesting report by the Lancet it's called “ensuring that the health of a child born today is not defined by a changing climate”. It's a very important piece of paper, and it talks about all these the only change in climate that might affect health.  It talks about infections, about mosquitoes, about vibrio colerae. The increase the temperature of sea water increases the amount of vibrio we've found.    \nFig.29 \nFig.30 \nFig.31 \nFig.32 \nFig.33 \nFig.34 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           12 Sometimes climate is not induced by humans, that's what happened in Pakistan in 2022 big flood (fig.35), like one third of Pakistan was actually under water, that's (fig.35 right) the cases of malaria just in the months after the flood. The pools of water everywhere they bring much more mosquitoes, more malaria.   If you like this kind of topic that's (fig.36) a report of the WHO UN committee on biodiversity and pandemics it's really interesting because there are probably 1.7 million unknown viruses, half of them have the potential to infect humans and we only know 10,000.   Animals they cannot increase the changes in the environment caused by humans, that can actually increase the risk of pandemics. Land use change, forestation agricultural expansion, urbanization, biodiversity, climate change what is the threat for natural wildlife? After ebola epidemics in West Africa it was forbidden to bring animals from Africa to the other parts of the world legally, so they were brought illegally so the controls increased a lot. Someone suspected that COVID19 was actually due to the import of birds and bats from Africa to Asia. Most of the diseases we see now are actually associated with animals, so the more you get next to animals the higher risk you have to get this disease or the virus that might be asymptomatic in animals, like rabies.  That's the density of physicians (fig.37B), so number of people per physician, and certain countries you see there are more than 3,000 people per one or two, this (fig.37D) is the density of dogs, this (fig.38) is the expenditure for rabies and every six seconds one person dies of rabies. Numbers are terrible, we absolutely not do enough, we're not investing money for rabies.   We already talked about the pox so we're not going to go there, but again pox tells you something about how close we get to wild animals and how quickly we move around the world.  In terms of resistance, antibiotic resistance is very important. We’re going to talk about MDR pathogens, we talk about NDM metalloprotease (they’re called NDM since they were found in the river next to New Dehli NDLE in an antibiotics factory). Probably, in the production process, several antibiotics were just released in the river. That’s (fig.39) a cartoon that tells something about how much antibiotics that are unnecessary are used, which are a lot. What happens when someone takes ciprofloxacin? People urinate, 95% of the times, and urine goes to rivers, it goes to the soil, so the rivers are full of antibiotics, the soil is full of antibiotics. What is done with animals? Intensive breeding includes the use of antibiotics for infections prevention, there are a lot of antibiotics in meat. This was just to describe how antibiotics are used. MDR pathogens are really increasing, it is an estimation, a lot of people are dying of MDR infections.    \nFig.35 \nFig.36 \nFig.37 \nFig.38 \nFig.39 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           13 POPULATION CHANGES There are also population changes. There are older people in countries such as Italy, Italy is a very old country, and that’s one of the reasons why there was such a high mortality with COVID-19, for example we will talk about the change in the elderly, and there are also more complex patients: immunosuppression now is very wide, there are hundreds of drugs that can induce immunosuppression, we also have aggressive treatment of diseases. We use a lot of different protheses, think of a joint prothesis, now every person above the age of 70 has for example a knee prosthesis. We have an increasing worldwide prevalence of diabetes and obesity, both conditions include some changes in immunosuppression: all of these examples include risk of infections. In chemotherapy for instance, what happens? Usually there is mucositis, because all cells are killed, including cancer cells and gut cells, leading to malabsorption, but also bacteria cross the barrier from the gut to get to the blood, hence people will get bacteremia and sepsis.  SETTINGS AND INFECTIONS Settings are also important. When we will talk about resistance, community life infections are really different from hospital ones, and there is an average category called healthcare-associated infections, so those in which people living at home that often undergo dialysis for example, long-term facilities for elderly are all considered to be in the average. But, for example jail, jail is a setting in which you have a very high rate of infections, why? Why are there more infections in jail? First of all, often there are many people that are physically close to each other, also, sex and rape happen in jail, drugs use happens in jail. Switzerland, in the year 2000, since the rate of HIV infections and other STDs was too high, decided to give free condoms and free syringes. We talk about tropical diseases and immigration, we talk about war: every time we talk about war, we talk about STDs, soldiers often have sex with sex workers, rapes are part of the picture unfortunately, STDs are really common, but that’s not the only thing. Wars also mean migration, displacement of people; what happened to the latest cholera epidemic in the world? 3 million people had cholera in Yemen.  THE “CHAIN OF INFECTION” This involves the breaking of the chain of infections. So, these (fig.42) are all the things that we need to consider, we have host factors, environment, pathogen, portal of entry, so the things to know in order to figure out what to do to break these chains. (The professor states that the students can read the factors on their own fig.43A,B,C,D,E).       \nFig.40 \nFig.41 \nFig.42 \nFig.43A Fig.43B Fig.43C Fig.43D Fig.43E 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           14      TRANSPORTATION CLUSTERS It’s important to see how microorganisms move around the world, it has a political implication. This (fig.44) is a transportation cluster, so how many people are moving around the world in one year, just to give the density: of course, it’s more dense in Europe, North America, Asia, etc.. It’s estimated that around 1.5 billion people every year move from their country to another.   NEW HYBRID CORONAVIRUS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERE HUMAN DISEASES This (fig.45) is the example of coronaviruses, there is SARS-1and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). There is the one from China, the yellow one, then MERS, which is less spread but still it went to all continents. I think you’ve heard about the idea that “migrants bring diseases”, is it true? A study was carried out in Europe concerning this topic, and they wanted to see how many cases of non-autoctonous infections were associated with migration and how many were associated with tourists: they found 274 high risk non-autoctonous infections in Europe, and 90-92% were related to travelling, this is because integration of minor populations communities is really low, so the chances of spread are really low. Pathogens can also migrate with animals. We can talk about West Nile, that’s what happened with the West Nile virus. We didn’t have West Nile, birds came from east of Africa/Middle East mostly, a migration of birds happened and things changed.  ZIKA VIRUS We will talk about Zika virus. Zika virus probably started in Africa, it was discovered in 1947 in Africa and then it spread to the Pacific then it went all over the world. Then only when it got to South America we discovered a serious complication of Zika: microcephaly, brain malformation if Zika virus is contracted in pregnancy. We didn't know that. We had epidemics before, all over the 60s, in the Pacific area. It could be not even reaching like thousands of millions of people so this can’t change the pathogenesis and the genetics of people are different so that's how virus interact: with the brain changes, with animal changes, with different areas and there's also changes in prevention. In the three countries in red (fig.46) we have less coverage of measles vaccination, so where the second dose of measles vaccination is less than 4% (the one usually done in teenagers). The three countries are France, Italy and Romania. Greece doesn't provide vaccination. Think: which are the four countries with the highest incidence of measles in Europe? France, Italy, Romania and Greece. Prevention strategies and vaccination are really important inprevention of these infections. \nFig.44 \nFig.45 \nFig.46 29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           15 But things can change quickly. I just took last week a look at the WHO website (they have an epidemics web page in which they tell you which are the disease outbreaks around the world) andjust to give you an idea, last week we had Avian influenzaA(H5N1) in Vietnam, also different strands of influenza in China,we had psittacosis in Europe, we had several cases of yellow fever in Congo, Ghana and Central Africa, we had Nipa Virus in Bangladesh (Nipa Virus is really nasty, probably transmitted by rats and flying foxes and it can give respiratory symptoms, can have high mortality and MERS). So very big changes of outbreaks in the world.   EMERGING INFECTIONS I want to talk a little bit about emerging infections, you've probably heard about it. Emerging infections are defined as those recently discovered or re-emerged in different geographic areas. They can be new infection, can be unrecognized, etc. That's (fig.47) the slide that Anthony Fauci, the US president counselor, prepared in 2017 for presenting why the US should invest money in ID, because 4 years ago this method almost ended. But now we have emerging viruses, now we do it always (spread, animals, etc) and also our past ability to identify viruses and other pathogens. Plague. I think, I didn't think I've ever seen one like plague again like 4 centuries ago. Actually, this is the last epidemic we had, they had in Madagascar or Ebola. We briefly touched on Ebola on the fact that we discovered that Ebola can be transmitted sexually,so months after the epidemics, male survivors can spread Ebola by sex. That's something we absolutely had no idea about.   CRIMEA-CONGO HEMORRAGIC FEVER The last example I wanted to give you is the Crimea-Congo hemorragic fever. It's a virus, usually every year we have a few cases in the Middle East, Central Asia and South Africa. It’s transmitted by ticks, specific ticks: it’s called the Hyalomma. It's a very aggressive tick so it's not just a tick that stays there on the plants and if you pass there you just get a tick, they follow people because they want to infect them. So what happened? Well, in 2016 one Spanish guy, just went into a thorough walk next to Avila in the center of Spain. He went home and 3 days afterwards he developed high fever, confusion, sepsis and died in 48 hours. He was brought to ICU and the nurse that first was taking care of him the ER actually got infected too.She survived and this time they were able to diagnose the virusand they discovered that since 2010 the Hyalomma ticks in that region had the virus in them. So the virus was there for at least 6 years before we saw the first case. Why is it important? Well, mostly because the virus was found in Italy in 2017 in a bird (in a tick) and just a few months ago, October 2023 a cow tick was found to be positive in the Alps between France and Italy. So the virus is here and we need to be prepared because we can have episodes of hemorrhaging feverdue to the Crimea-Congo hemorrhaging virus. So again, the important part of this is the change that there’s needto be: some of that depends on humans some on climate, some on animals but the only way to to be prepared is actually to perform surveillance and take a look at the disease, birds animals, etc.      \nFig.47 \nFig.48  29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           16 FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO) We will not have much time to go through fever of unknown origin. It's a chapter, I think really fascinating because you just think of all the causes of fever, the definition, reason to change. That’s a very important angle to watch and actually they touch on all the infection causes. For the first time, they included metagenomics so again, if you're not able to diagnose the cause of fever try to go for NGS, next generation sequencing, try to find whatever pathogen you might find. It's the first time that it's(metagenomics) included in any algorithm so probably in the future we'll do the headings. So we have no idea unless we just don't look at the microbiome in an unbiased way because we don't have a test for this one and the same for others.   ID CONSULTATION IN PRACTICE \nIt’s a bit wide. I would like to do more practice and somehow talk to you about what's an ID consultation in practice, what we do when we consult. So the first thing is actually we ask questions that usually other doctors don't do: for example that's a list of the questions (fig.50) I usually ask when I'm consulting. So: • travel (we discussed about areas not only the Tropics, even areas in Europe: Chykunguya Virus in Europe, Borrelia Burgdoferi etc • vaccination/prophilaxis I don't know if you've already read some medical history but often we don't have that history, we only have that for COVID. But what about pneumococcus, meningococcus etc.? • hobbies potential exposure to certain potentially toxic substances in lungs. Working can be important and hobbies as well, people that do hobbies with fresh water like kayaking for instance, or swimming in lakes and rivers they can be exposed to things that live in fresh water.  Leptospirosis for example is transmitted by the urine of rodents, so that's a risk you need to understand, or by just walking in the woods you can get tick bites. Contact with animals, domestic animals can be important, let’s think about cat-spread disease, dog ticks, animals can have fleas, you can get in contact with wild animals such as a fox or a bat or a raccoon. • That is a very stupid question, but does any person in your complex have the same symptoms as you?  Very basic basic question about spread, contact spread or respiratory spread of disease. • We can ask about food intoxication, one of the classic thing is like a wedding or a large banquet in which all people start having gastrointestinal symptoms at the same time. We can also somehow track the food itself, there are certain toxins that are more typical in like egg derivates or creams… • One question we always do is “are you fond of diary products?” ,  because it's usually done with unposterised milk salmonella, listeria, TB can be transmitted by dairy products. There is a question about requirements and previous infections that's important you have several infections at the same time sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia etc., but one cause is actually  immunodeficiency, in immunology you study all the severe immunodeficiency, the congenital ones, we talked about HIV but there \nFig.49  \nFig.50  29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           17 is a lot of moderate immunodeficiency, complement deficiency, they can be a cause of repeated infection and often patients don't have those measures to understand the cause. • Hepatitis and STIs: we try to ask questions about sex, the way that we discuss it's not all that easy but it's important to understand the risk and the prevention. We talk about drugs; you will see that it's really common to ask a patient, we ask if they smokes or we ask if they drink alcohol. We don't often ask if they use drugs and you know there's so many drugs there's all the talk of chemsex, so we go back to sex and drugs. We ask about tattoos, it's important in terms of risk of HIV and other blood-borne diseases. • A question we might get is tissue organ abnormalities, one respect for endocarditis, very strong one is having had another endocarditis in life, once you have damaged the valve the risk of getting second endocarditis is much higher. Same thing with TB, people might be at a high risk of aspergillosis, because of the previous damage to the structure.  • Risk of hospitalization. Why do we ask if the patient was hospitalized in the last three months? There's a common infection and colonization, so it's important that we consider these risks in terms of treatment. • We ask about devices and prosthetic  materials, we have now a patients hospitalized that use an aortic prosthesis because and the prosthesis got infected. Well he actually had is spondylodiscite and the infection spread fro the vertebrae to the prosthesis, but you can’t just cut the aorta and then just put that there so this infection will not be able to be eradicated, because it has a device that cannot be changed and that is infected so in this case we will use suppressed treatment, so we try to keep on the treatment for a very long time. • The last point is actually allergy to antibiotics. It’s something we ask but I invite you to ask precisely, because people will tell that they are allergic to amoxicillin because they had diarrhea, everyone has diarrhea with antibiotics because of dysbiosis of microbioma etc. That's not allergy and in that case we will not use the galactose, so please characterize antibiotic allergy. In case we need certain antibiotics it's important that we talk to the allergologist and try to desensitize. There are several protocols, you can start with a low dose but if you increase the dose you get to a normal dose, you don't stop and people can tolerate. Don't do that if they have edema, but in milder cases you can do it.  The second point (fig.49) is the pattern of symptoms and particularly of fever. That's (fig.51) something I found on the internet it's well done. There are so many different kinds of fevers: intermittent fever, remittent fever, continuous fever…  When we think of malaria as having fever between 2 or 3 days you will never see it, it's a historical thing in people who have not treated malaria and have had like high fever every 2 or 3 days, but it's not as impossible to see.   Another example is undulant fever: it's fever just going up and very slowly going down, very well tolerated by patients and you will smell the livestock smell in the patient. Brucellosis is there but I think in like 20 years I only saw one patient diagnosed like this because of undulant fever and this kind of smell. Fever patterns can be important in terms of just giving you a hint on what to do.  Look at number 3 (fig.49) consider epidemiology: we talk about trouble, of course we are understanding where people were, understanding epidemiology is important for how to change it. Now we started measuring and trying to diagnose dengue in all patients presented with fever, why? Because we know that last year we had 81 cases of dengue in Italy. People never heard about it, now dengue is autoctonous, so if you don't know it you will not just ask a test but miss dengue. Sometimes it is really uncommon, for exmple we had a patient  that had malaria, and had never been out of Italy. That was really really uncommon and unfortunate. I think using epidemiology can really help, you but you need to be updated on your own.  \nFig.51  29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           18 That’s (fig.52) the cases of West Nile Virus in Europe, well in 2018 there was a very high rise, but the important thing is that they were just from May to October, so zero cases in the other months, no mosquitos. But its changed with ticks. Now we have ticks from March to November.   Point number 4 (fig.49) is consider more common bacteria, so when we have to cover and start the treatment we need to think which is the most common cause of these? You will have books telling you all the protocols, such as triaxon plus azythromycin for pneumonia, ciprofloxacin for gastritis, fosfomycin for UTIs... You will have these kind of protocols and it’s correct, but the important thing you have to think is which are the most common cause of that kind of infection, the most important thing is when we talk about (unintelligible)  they are caused by 90% of stafilococci. When you go deeper, to necrotizing facsitis you do have a lot anaerobs, because in the fascia you don’t have oxygen, so anaerobs are more important. Think about the most important ones, gram+, gram-, atypical pneumonia, we think legionella, we think chlamydia we think some other ones. Think of the more common groups of bacteria but also consider which patient might be colonized and infected by MDR. These are the maps (fig.53), when we talk about MDR bacteria, you see that Italy is really bad it is red in almost all maps, that means the prevalence of resistant bacteria is the highest in Europe. It is the case for example of vancomycin resistant enterococci (fig.53 left), which we have about 20-50%. This (fig.53 right) is the Klebsiella pneumoniae, 20-50%. If you do have Klebsiella think how many of my patients might have the resistant form? I need to understand the epidemiology.  Q: unintelligible A: There are several reasons, I think probably the best one is infection control. If you go to any hospital you will see you see how many doctors and nurses actually do wash correctly their hands before renting the room after touching something in the room after getting out of the room before putting gloves on and after taking out the gloves. I see people just putting intravenous devices with bare hands. I think this infection control is really bad. The second thing is about age, Italy is one of the oldest countries, elderly are high risk of resistant ones.  The important thing is to see not only the country level, but the regional, hospital level and even the patient level is very different. Patients that are admitted to urology wards have the highest risk of having the urine tract colonized by resistant bacteria, they go in and out of surgery… it's important to get an idea of which are the bacteria in in your hospital, in your ward, This is not really done systematically but it should.   Number 5 (fig.49) is actually think of abnormal things. We often are called when the doctors try anything so all the antibodies and see the patient with fever and raise CRP or whatever and ask us what clould that be. Thinking about uncommon microorganism is important. I just put here (fig.54) stuff that again we don't have time to think of, but Q fever is caused by coxiella burnetii, an uncommon pathogen transmitted by interactive animals, with unexplained fever an negative hemoculture. Mucormycosis is a very uncommon fungus usually seen in severe immuno-compromized hosts.  Think of uncommon things is important and think of something that is not a bacteria. \nFig.52  \nFig.53  \nFig.54  29.04.2024                                                                                                                                                 CALCAGNO L.12   \nEleonora Deinite, Erica Veronesi                                                                                                                                           19 Last but not least consider inefficient source control. These (fig.55) are all infections that are not controlled, so even if you do the right antibiotic treatment for the right duration but if you are not able to clear the primary focus  patients will have relapses or will still keep on with fever and raise inflammation. People can have  sinusitis, in certain cases you don't aspirate, people will just keep on without curating. It's not really clear because sometimes they don't have many symptoms. Endocarditis is a very difficult diagnosis because you read in the books that people have fever and a heart murmur. Half of my patients have heart murmurs and fever so we will not do the diagnosis, so we need to think of a potential cause of endocarditis.  I have a patient now that came in with bilateral pyelonephritis, young man, 40 degrees of fever, sepsis and I see in the scan and he has bilateral pyelonephritis. He’s a male, he is young, it's really uncommon to have pyelonephritis and much more uncommon to have a bilateral pyelonephritis. That's the case in which I think of the endocarditis and embolization through the bloodstream. The abdomen is very important in surgery. most of the patients in surgery might have deep infection tissue, like abdominal abscesses, no symptoms, just fever, and if you don’t drain the abscess people have relapses. For what concerns intravenous devices we will talk about bloodstram infection, BSI. If a patient has a central venous catheter, we need to understand if the bacteria comes from the central venous catheter or not. There are certain things we can do to understand and if the central venous catheter is infected, we need to remove it. That is the last slide (fig.56), and it’s about iatrogenic cause of fever. Sometimes we're told when people are taking ropenem, vancomycin, tetracyclin, acetomycin, fluconazole and fever is still there. We just go through the case, try to understand, read the source somewhere, there are drugs that can cause fever, even antibiotics. Sometimes what we do if the patient is not septic is remove all antimicrobial treatments, we wait for 48 to 72 hours to repeat all the cultures and we see the fever range. Fever can be caused by all these drugs (fig.56), look here many antibiotics can cause fever carbapenems, erythromycin, penicillins. \nFig.55  \nFig.56", "input": "", "output": "- what is it? >>>\n    -
